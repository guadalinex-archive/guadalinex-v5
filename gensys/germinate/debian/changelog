germinate (0.42) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change Maintainer address back to cjwatson@ubuntu.com; I generally work
    on this package on work time.
  * germinate-update-metapackage honours new Task-Seeds and Task-Metapackage
    seed headers, replacing previous seed_map/* and metapackage_map/*
    entries in update.cfg.
  * Fix error message on failing to download non-bzr seeds.
  * Update kubuntu-meta example in germinate-update-metapackage(1).
  * Simplify germinate-update-metapackage changelog output when a package
    moves from depends to recommends or vice versa.
  * Remove obsolete dh_python call from debian/rules.

germinate (0.41) unstable; urgency=low

  * Plant seeds in topologically-sorted order. The intent of this change is
    the same as that in 0.40, only this time it should actually work in the
    face of seeds that inherit from other seeds that are overridden in a
    different branch.
  * On the other hand, continue to use the last entry in the source
    STRUCTURE file as the supported seed. It may not be topologically last
    if there are seeds in included branches that are not inherited by
    supported.
  * Remove overridden entries from 'structure' output file.

germinate (0.40) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix ordering of seed planting in the event that a seed in an included
    branch is overridden by one with different inheritance.

germinate (0.39) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Jonathan Riddell ]
  * Use 'bzr checkout --lightweight' to speed up seed checkouts.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Allow "metapackage_map/SEED" configuration file entries in
    update-metapackage, which can be used to generate output metapackages
    whose names do not match the generating seed names.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Thu, 14 Feb 2008 14:38:56 +0000

germinate (0.38) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix germination from multiple seed sources in bzr mode.
  * germinate-update-metapackage now automatically expands the seeds option
    for seed inheritance, so you no longer usually need to have separate
    seeds and output_seeds options in update.cfg.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue, 12 Feb 2008 11:30:53 +0000

germinate (0.37) unstable; urgency=low

  * Output a .seedtext file for each seed, containing the verbatim text of
    the seed.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Thu, 07 Feb 2008 11:30:39 +0000

germinate (0.36) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add special-case handling of supported+build-depends to
    germinate-pkg-diff.
  * Add -S/--seed-source, -s/--seed-dist, and -d/--dist options to
    germinate-pkg-diff.
  * Add support for germinating from multiple seed sources as well as
    multiple branches. This is needed to support "third-party" seed branches
    that are stored in a different location from branches they include.
  * Fix rescuing of packages from extra, broken in 0.32.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue, 29 Jan 2008 21:53:30 +0000

germinate (0.35) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make germinate-update-metapackage only blacklist the metapackage being
    generated, not all metapackages. See LP #148075.
  * Change default distribution to hardy.
  * Vcs-Bzr is now an official field.
  * Fix 'structure' output file; records were being separated by the empty
    string rather than by newlines, which made it rather useless.
  * Add an 'include' facility to the STRUCTURE file to allow seeds from one
    branch to inherit from seeds in another branch.
  * Automatically compute the transitive closure of inheritance
    relationships in the STRUCTURE file, rather than requiring them to be
    written out by hand. In other words, if you have 'minimal: required'
    then you can simply write 'standard: minimal' rather than 'standard:
    required minimal'. This is a requirement for sane use of 'include',
    since it may not be straightforward to hardcode the inheritance
    relationships among seeds in another branch.
  * Unhardcode the 'supported' seed. The last seed in the STRUCTURE file is
    now used for build-depends calculations.
  * Policy version 3.7.3: no changes required.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Thu, 24 Jan 2008 14:25:16 +0000

germinate (0.34) unstable; urgency=low

  * Follow Recommends in Section: metapackages as if they were Depends.
  * Ignore leading and trailing whitespace and blank lines in STRUCTURE
    files.
  * Allow comments (starting with #) in STRUCTURE files.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Thu, 02 Aug 2007 12:05:40 +0100

germinate (0.33) unstable; urgency=low

  * Honour recommends in germinate-pkg-diff.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Thu, 19 Jul 2007 09:07:16 +0100

germinate (0.32) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use dch -iU rather than dch -U. (I use
    DEBCHANGE_RELEASE_HEURISTIC=changelog so never noticed the problem.)
  * Fix germinate-pkg-diff --mode option (was incorrectly --mirror, contrary
    to its meaning and the documentation).
  * Make germinate-pkg-diff work again even if supported is not in its list
    of seeds.
  * germinate-pkg-diff now automatically adds inherited seeds as necessary.
    Thus, the default list of seeds is reduced to simply 'desktop'.
  * Download package index files to a temporary directory if they aren't
    going to be saved.
  * Clean up package index files downloaded for germinate-pkg-diff.
  * Add germinate-pkg-diff -a/--arch option.
  * Update copyright dates.
  * Add manual pages for germinate-pkg-diff and
    germinate-update-metapackage.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Wed, 18 Jul 2007 14:00:50 +0100

germinate (0.31) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix excluding packages from seeds other than extra.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Fri, 13 Jul 2007 10:08:24 +0100

germinate (0.30) unstable; urgency=low

  * Generalise Extra-Include and Extra-Exclude to allow rescuing packages
    from any seed, not just extra. For example, Mobile-Include: *-dev will
    rescue all packages from sources that generate binaries named *-dev in
    the mobile output.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue, 10 Jul 2007 17:43:30 +0100

germinate (0.29) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add Vcs-Bzr control field.
  * Use dch -U if available.
  * Document meaning of seed entries in parentheses.
  * Remove old arch-tag lines.
  * PEP-8 import ordering.
  * Add --version option to all programs.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Fri, 06 Jul 2007 12:26:52 +0100

germinate (0.28) unstable; urgency=low

  * Try to fall back to alternative dependencies if one is blacklisted.
  * Honour blacklist entries even if they're explicitly seeded.
  * Don't apply blacklists (apart from the "supported" blacklist) to
    build-dependencies.
  * Be a little more verbose when blacklisting packages.
  * Allow "seed_map/SEED" configuration file entries in update-metapackage
    to have an output metapackage read its package list from multiple seeds
    (needed for splitting required and minimal in the Ubuntu seeds).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat, 23 Jun 2007 20:56:11 +0100

germinate (0.27) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add support for negative architecture specifications, e.g. [!powerpc].
  * Document % and [arch] seed syntaxes in germinate(1).
  * Add support for prefixing seed entries with "!" to enforce blacklisting
    packages from the containing seed and any of its inner seeds. For
    example, this allows a package to be in Ubuntu main but blacklisted from
    being shipped on CDs.
  * Change default distribution to gutsy.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Fri, 01 Jun 2007 12:54:27 +0100

germinate (0.26) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change default non-bzr seed location to
    http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-archive/seeds/.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon, 12 Mar 2007 12:01:14 +0000

germinate (0.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change default distribution to feisty.
  * Fix file descriptor leak in Germinator.parseStructure().
  * Put the contents of the STRUCTURE seed file in a new "structure" output
    file.
  * Change default seed distribution to "ubuntu.feisty"; note new naming
    scheme.
  * Fetch seeds from
    http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev/ubuntu-seeds/ by default if
    the --bzr option is used.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue, 12 Dec 2006 09:29:46 +0000

germinate (0.24) unstable; urgency=low

  * When processing whole-source seed entries, only include real packages.
    This avoids slews of warnings for binaries that only exist on other
    architectures, and avoids mistakenly picking up virtual packages.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue,  3 Oct 2006 11:59:45 +0100

germinate (0.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix recommends-related changelog entries from update-metapackage.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat,  9 Sep 2006 18:44:37 +0100

germinate (0.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix crash when promoting from lesser seeds.
  * Include recommends in main outputs (they should continue to appear in
    Task headers and such, just not in metapackage dependencies), and create
    a .seed-recommends output for just the seeded recommendations.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat,  9 Sep 2006 15:28:57 +0100

germinate (0.21ubuntu1) edgy; urgency=low

  * added support for recommends in seeds via enclosing the
    packagename in '('..')'. E.g. 
    * (pkgname)     # this will produce a recommends

 -- Michael Vogt <michael.vogt@ubuntu.com>  Thu,  7 Sep 2006 16:44:36 +0200

germinate (0.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add optional output_seeds setting (defaults to value of seeds) in
    update.cfg, to allow seeds to be germinated for inheritance purposes
    without being output.
  * Sort added and removed packages in metapackage changelogs.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon,  7 Aug 2006 16:19:15 +0100

germinate (0.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Consider sources from inner seeds while rescuing packages from extra (so
    e.g. in Ubuntu Extra-Include in supported should look at source packages
    from minimal etc. as well as from supported).
  * Rescue from sources in the build tree in a separate pass, and add
    rescued packages to the depends/build-depends lists rather than
    pretending that they're explicitly seeded. This means that rescued
    packages end up correctly in supported or supported+build-depends
    depending on whether their source packages were found while processing
    dependencies or build-dependencies.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Wed,  5 Jul 2006 13:08:34 +0100

germinate (0.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Allow shell-style globs in seeds wherever regular expressions are
    allowed. (Regular expressions are surrounded by /.../, making this
    unambiguous.)
  * Add support for Extra-Include and Extra-Exclude variables, which allow
    automatically rescuing packages that match certain patterns from extra
    (https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/seed-cleanup).
  * Tweak logging priorities for messages about virtual seed entries.
  * Don't display debugging messages by default; add germinate -v/--verbose
    option to display them.
  * Use sets rather than lists where possible. This roughly halves the
    runtime for the Ubuntu seeds.
  * Add extras recursively: binaries generated by sources pulled in by
    dependencies or build-dependencies of extra binaries should themselves
    be extra.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue,  4 Jul 2006 11:57:47 +0100

germinate (0.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Convert to python-support.
  * Move python and python-support build-dependencies to
    Build-Depends-Indep.
  * Policy version 3.7.2.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat,  1 Jul 2006 12:33:24 +0100

germinate (0.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix d-i kernel version pruning to happen early enough to exclude seeded
    packages for the wrong kernel version (which can easily happen e.g. if
    regex seeds are used).
  * If no Kernel-Version variable is given, allow all udebs with
    Kernel-Version headers rather than none of them.
  * Change default distribution to edgy.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Wed, 21 Jun 2006 18:10:40 +0100

germinate (0.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add --bzr option to automatically check out seeds from bzr.
  * Switch from urllib to urllib2.
  * Refactor duplicated seed-fetching code into new Germinate.seeds module.
  * Add optional seed_dist setting in update.cfg files, to allow setting a
    default seed distribution.
  * Add --bzr option to update-metapackage as well (mostly implementing
    https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/ubuntu-meta-from-bzr).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Fri,  9 Jun 2006 12:15:01 +0100

germinate (0.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Source moved to bzr; update copyright file.
  * Add germinate-update-metapackage script to help manage updating
    ubuntu-meta et al (thanks, Gustavo Franco; closes:
    https://launchpad.net/bugs/37917).
  * Improve man page documentation of --seed-packages slightly (see
    #363536).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Fri,  9 Jun 2006 01:04:21 +0100

germinate (0.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move Python modules to /usr/lib/germinate; .pyc/.pyo files are
    architecture-dependent.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat, 13 May 2006 10:05:37 +0100

germinate (0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build-depend on python (closes: #363040).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon, 17 Apr 2006 11:44:13 +0100

germinate (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to Debian (closes: #360631).
  * Switch to my debian.org maintainer address.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon,  3 Apr 2006 23:25:23 +0100

germinate (0.11) dapper; urgency=low

  * Fix plantSeed() backward incompatibility for *-meta/update scripts by
    defaulting seedrelease to None.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 22 Feb 2006 15:56:35 +0000

germinate (0.10) dapper; urgency=low

  * Add seed distribution name to seed descriptions in the "Why" column.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 21 Feb 2006 18:07:16 +0000

germinate (0.9) dapper; urgency=low

  * When processing the build tree, germinate is (correctly) careful not to
    promote packages from lesser seeds, since we still want to consider them
    (e.g.) part of ship even if they're build-dependencies of desktop.
    However, this sometimes caused us to select the wrong alternative from
    an or-ed build-dependency (e.g. redland Build-Depends:
    libmysqlclient15-dev | libmysqlclient12-dev | libmysqlclient10-dev and
    libmysqlclient15-dev was in the Ubuntu supported seed). To fix this,
    process the packages at that point anyway and just avoid promoting them.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 20 Feb 2006 13:51:30 +0000

germinate (0.8) dapper; urgency=low

  * When identifying extras, check for binaries built from multiple source
    packages and skip any superseded binaries.
  * Change default for --components to main and restricted, since the Ubuntu
    seeds rely on packages from restricted in order to germinate correctly.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 14 Feb 2006 12:11:24 +0000

germinate (0.7) dapper; urgency=low

  * Depend on python-apt (thanks, Jani Monoses).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 29 Nov 2005 19:23:45 +0000

germinate (0.6) dapper; urgency=low

  * Add regular expression support in seeds. Weaken architecture
    specification error checking in order to be able to use [...] in regular
    expressions more easily.
  * Add support for including all the binaries from a given source package
    (using "%source") in seeds.
  * Add germinate --cleanup option, to prevent caching of Packages and
    Sources files.
  * Add germinate --source-mirror option, to allow Packages and Sources
    files to be on different mirrors (e.g. Ubuntu ports architectures).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 16 Nov 2005 14:37:37 +0000

germinate (0.5) dapper; urgency=high

  * Stop accidentally including extra in the all and supported+build-depends
    outputs.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Sun, 30 Oct 2005 12:35:47 -0500

germinate (0.4) dapper; urgency=low

  * Don't attempt to satisfy versioned dependencies of .debs using virtual
    packages, as the packaging toolchain doesn't support that. (udpkg/anna
    do support this for .udebs, and the installer relies on that.)
  * Change default distribution to dapper.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 25 Oct 2005 12:14:07 +0100

germinate (0.3) breezy; urgency=low

  * Add a man page for germinate.
  * Explain in pkg-diff --help that you can supply a list of seeds to
    compare against as non-option arguments.
  * Update pkg-diff's default seeds to 'minimal standard desktop', to match
    the breezy seeds.
  * Add germinate --seed-packages option, to allow calculating dependencies
    of individual extra packages during a germinate run.
  * Policy version 3.6.2. No changes required.
  * Update GPL notices with the FSF's new address.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 31 Aug 2005 18:47:20 +0100

germinate (0.2) breezy; urgency=low

  * Fix formatting of output lines with UTF-8 maintainer strings.
  * Really pick the first reason from the build-dependency tree to display
    in output files.
  * Record allowed d-i kernel versions on a per-seed basis, so that we can
    have some kernel versions supported for netboot installations only.
  * Force a trailing slash onto the end of any --seed-source argument.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 26 May 2005 16:32:38 +0100
