Welcome to Ubuntu ${DEBIAN_VERSION} (${CODENAME})!

This is an Ubuntu live ${MEDIA_TYPE},
built on ${BUILD_DATE}.

The default option is 'live'.

If the system fails to boot at all (the typical
symptom is a white screen which doesn't go away),
use 'live video=ofonly'.

Press the tab key for a list of options, or type
'help' for help.

************************************
If in doubt, just press Enter, and if that
doesn't work, type 'live video=ofonly'.
