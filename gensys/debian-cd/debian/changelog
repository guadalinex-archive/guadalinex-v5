debian-cd (2.2.23) unstable; UNRELEASED

  * Steve McIntyre
    - Added sed hack to make sarge appear as "stable" in the Release
      files we generate on the CDs.
    - Download the release notes and try to fit them onto
      CD#1. Updated sarge's README.html.in to point to them
	- Updated tools/add-bin-doc to stop warnings on this.
    - Added patch from Sven Luther to add a forth script to make
 	  ppc/pegasos easier to boot.  Closes: #311925
    - Re-add the kernel-headers packages to match kernel images (only
	  on i386 and amd64). Closes: #249386
    - Made list2cds more verbose
    - Added tools/sarge/upgrade-hppa.sh and tools/sarge/upgrade-sparc.sh
      to install the upgrade-kernel bits on CD#1
    - Added tools/dedicated_source: simple script used to add extra
      source packages onto _binary_ CDs. Used for the amd64 sarge release
      so far.
  * Joey Hess
    - Synced up all sarge changes to etch.
    - Use dpkg --print-architecture instead of now-deprecated
      --print-installation-architecture
  * Stephen R. Marenka
    - Changed m68k boot for etch to handle etch changes in d-i.
	
debian-cd (2.2.22) unstable; urgency=critical

  * Steve McIntyre
    - Prepared YA "last before sarge" debian-cd release
    - Urgency "Critical" to make sure we make it in...
  * Joey Hess
    - Add post-sarge udebs rescue-check, initrd-preseed, and preseed-common
      to the udeb exclude list since these will be/are inluded on sid initrds.
    - Add etch directories; point sid symlinks to them.
    - Add rescue stanzas to etch isolinux.cfg. Rescue mode is supported in
      post-sarge d-i images only.
    - Add support for f4.txt that is for systems with the 2.6 kernel.
    - Exclude new mouse-modules udebs from CDs until something in d-i uses
      them.
    - debian-installer task files renamed to include distro name and branched
      for etch.
  * Steve McIntyre
    - Make woody's post-boot-mipsel script cope with extra fields in the
      output of sarge's isoinfo
    - Add Suggests: on netpbm and syslinux. Closes: #301345
    - Count the total number of binary and source discs better; sarge can
      have more than 9 CDs, so ?.packages doesn't cut it any more.
    - Don't copy the whole d-i cdrom directory onto CD1 for amd64.
      Closes: #306926
    - Don't copy boot.img.gz onto amd64 CD1.
    - Added Manty's testingcds script as an example of debian-cd use
    - Updated sarge task lists to match the latest sarge CD build
  * Santiago Garcia
    - Allow the usage of a local mirror of the daily d-i builds to be used
      for sid_d-i builds, this is done by setting DI_WWW_HOME=default and
      DI_DIR=/path/to/the/mirror
    - Add autorun capabilities to i386 cds so that instead of getting the
      "what do you want Windows to do" question under XP, we get the html
      README started. Closes: #185238
    - Make the jigdos use the same naming scheme as the isos, as per my
      proposal to the list.
    - Add some amd64 patches from Goswin: Fixed boot-amd64 and added
      some packages missing on netinsts.
    - Port to etch previous changes I commited for sarge.

debian-cd (2.2.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * Steve McIntyre:
    - Prepared YA "last before sarge" debian-cd release.
  * Raphael Hertzog
    - One line patch to correct a five year old bug that nobody noticed !
      Closes: #285382
    - Change maintainer to "Debian CD Group <debian-cd@lists.debian.org>" and
      put myself into Uploaders (as well as Santiago Garcia Mantinan & Steve
      McIntyre). That's because I'm not keeping up well enough with debian-cd
      and I need more people involved in managing bugs.
    - Apply patch from Horms <horms@debian.org> to fix some problems with
      inclusion of local udebs. Closes: #258029
    - Apply another patch from horsm@debian.org to try to look for d-i images
      in "local" dirs first. Closes: #258026
    - Use LC_ALL=C when calling apt-cache since the output is now translated.
      Closes: #290959
  * Steve McIntyre
    - Substantially updated update-cd:
       - Cope with Woody r3 updates taking more than 1 CD per
         architecture.
       - (Optionally) use JTE mkisofs extensions to create jigdo
         files directly.
    - Added amd64 support in several places, looking (oddly) very similar
      to i386 for now. The help texts displayed by isolinux at boot still
      need updating - HELP!
  * Stephen R. Marenka
    - m68k: add kernel-image-2.4.27-amiga to debian-installer+kernel.
  * Santiago Garcia
    - Update debian-installer's tasks.
    - Update calc script and calc files.
    - Make i386 cds 8.3 filenaming compatible again.
    - Workaround the two kernels problem on hppa.
    - Fix the kernel-image-2.4.27-amiga thing on generate_di+k_list.
    - Add support for arm to generate_di+k_list.
  * Joey Hess again:
    - Since amd64 is not on standard debian mirrors, and generate_d-i+k_list
      must be runnable on them, make it chack for absence of amd64 Packages
      files and add a dummy kernel for amd64. This will need to be manually
      kept up-to-date by the amd64 people for now.
    - Didn't fix generate_di_list the same way, since doing so would be too
      hard. Next time tasks/debian-installer is updated using this script on
      a machine w/o the unofficial amd64 archive, the am64 info in the file
      will be lost.
    - Add DO NOT EDIT warning messages to generated files in cvs.
    - Check and revert manual modifications to tasks/base-sarge. This file is
      automatically generated and those mods would have been lost:
        - Add fileutils to generate_d-i+k_list, "until kernels get fixed",
          whatever that means.
        - arcboot was already in generate_d-i+k_list.
    - Update tasks/debian-installer+kernel using generate_d-i+k_list.
    - Sort package lists in tasks/base-sarge to ease comparisons when
      updating.
    - Update tasks/base-sarge for debootstrap 0.2.45. This includes the
      following removals:
         - aboot: already listed in debian-installer+kernel
         - gcc-3.2-base, libdb2, libgcrypt1, libgnutls7, libident,
           libdb2, libtasn1-0: obsolete
         - modconf: obsoleted by d-i
         - setserial: not base anymore
         - slang1: turned into slang1a-utf8
         - libident: not needed by base anymore
         - lilo: in debian-installer+kernel
         - mbr: not installed anymore
         - pcmcia-cs: in debian-installer+kernel
         - syslinux: not installed
         - "filesutils": typo; fileutils in generate_d-i+k_list for m68k
         - quik: in debian-installer+kernel
         - yaboot: in debian-installer+kernel
         - arcboot: in debian-installer+kernel
         - delo: in debian-installer+kernel
      And the following additions:
         - libdb4.2, libgcrypt11, libgcrypt7, libgnutls10, libgnutls11,
           libgpg-error0, libtasn1-2: new libraries
         - console-tools: now installed by debootstrap even on s390
    - Exclude all the new amd64 kernel images from cd #1, no space.
    - Forgot to exclude old kernel-image-2.6.7-1-686-smp from cd #1.
    - Add network-console-config to forcd1 since it's needed by the
      network-console udeb. Closes: #279238
    - Exclude xmail from CD1 (new MTA), and exim (old MTA)
    - Exclude some kernel-headers with no matching kernel-images from CD1.
    - Update task lists to reflect tasksel changes.
    - Exclude new kernels from CD1.
    - Switch mips daily builds to new builds by ths.
    - Update task files for tasksel 2.22.
    - Exclude more new kernel images from CD1.
    - Stop hardcoding sid as the distribution to take the installation manual
      from, use DI_CODENAME instead.
    - Add OMIT_MANUAL variable, which can be set to 1 to drop the install
      manual from small CDs to save space. We will probably be adding several
      new translations, and possibly PDFs, and that would use too much space
      on the small CDs.
    - Also make the README link to the manual on the Debian web site if
      OMIT_MANUAL=1.
    - Update the README to mention manual translations are available.
    - More README updates from patch by Frans Pop. Closes: #300301
    - libdevmapper1.00 renamed to libdevmapper1.01, update debian-installer
      task. Closes: #298724
    - Sparc daily builds moved.
  * Bdale Garbee
    - update tasks and tools to make 2.6.8 kernels primary on hppa
    - add ramdisk_size=16384 to palo call in post-boot-hppa 
  * Colin Watson
    - Disable CD timeout on powerpc.
    - Add localechooser to exclude-udebs.

debian-cd (2.2.20) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Joey Hess
    - Remove bogus init=/linuxrc, we have not had a linuxrc in d-i for a long
      time and I don't know how that managed to work.
    - Update path to ia64 cdrom/boot.img.
    - Tweaked exclude-udebs-i386, removing fat-modules as it's not available
      otherwise if booting from floppy, and removing excludes of partconf,
      partitioner, and discover2-data-udeb, which are not in unstable for i386
      any longer.
    - Updated exclude-udebs to match the current CD initrd package list.
    - Access floppy reorg.
    - Sparc daily builds moved to joshk's builds.
    - Update tasks for 2.4.27 and 2.6.8 kernels.
    - Remove access floppies to save space on netinsts. Also remove
      net-drivers floppy and some other things not really needed for install
      from CD.
    - Add 2.6 kernels to ia64 netinst CDs (and incidentially, update to
      2.4.27).
    - Drop i386 floppies that have gone away in d-i.
    - Put 2.4, not 2.6 kernels on hppa cd.
  * Stephen R. Marenka
    - Add support for m68k reorganization.
    - Bump m68k 2.4 kernels to 2.4.27.
    - Handle missing m68k/bvme6000 floppy.
  * Petter Reinholdtsen
    - New variable SPLASHPNG pointing to replacement splash image on i386.
  * Kenshi Muto
    - Fix cp routine around EXTRA_DISK_IMAGES in tools/boot/sarge/boot-i386
      (add space to cp arguments)
    - Add floppy/asian-root.img, floppy/mideast-root.img and
      floppy/cyrillic-root.img to EXTRA_DISK_IMAGES (but may it be treated
      as DISK_IMAGES?)
    - Fix typo in test evaluation. (tools/boot/sarge/boot-i386)
    - Add localization-config.
  * Colin Watson
    - Add "--" end of installer kernel params markers to yaboot.conf.
    - Drop compatibility with old powerpc 2.4/2.6 d-i image layout, since
      the changed image layout reached sarge a while ago.
    - Remove 2.4 images from power3 and power4; those few who want them can
      netboot.
    - Remove 2.6 PReP images from power3 and power4, as no such machines
      exist.
    - Hardlink powerpc and powerpc/minimal vmlinux files together, since
      they're identical.
    - Remove powerpc-small-pmac kernel from the netinst. base-installer
      hasn't installed it since April, and according to Sven it's only
      useful for building floppies.
  * Santiago Garcia
    - Try to fix powerpc DVD builds via -hfs-parms MAX_XTCSIZE.
    - Add prep powerpc support.
    - Update debian-installer tasks.
    - Add tools/calc script to update .calc files with up to date
      estimations on the iso size parameters.
  * Thiemo Seufer
    - Add arcboot to the mips tasks/base-sarge list, like it is done for
      other bootloaders.
    - Add a default bootfile named sashARCS for mips, aliased to r4k-ip22.
  * Joshua Kwan
    - Add ramdisk_size=16384 to silo.conf. closes: #274958
  * Steve McIntyre
    - Another upload before sarge.

debian-cd (2.2.19) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Steve McIntyre
    - (Hopefully this time) Final medium-urgency upload to get a
      recent debian-cd in before the sarge release. A few bugfixes needed:
    - Removed silly build-dep-indep on mkisofs. Closes: #258018
    - Fixed typo in tools/boot/sarge/boot-i386. Closes: #267026
  * Santiago Garcia
    - Change build.sh to allow building non complete CDs, like netinsts.

 -- Steve McIntyre <93sam@debian.org>  Fri, 20 Aug 2004 14:59:11 +0100

debian-cd (2.2.18) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Steve McIntyre
    - Final medium-urgency upload to get a recent debian-cd in before
      the sarge release.
    - Update default version to sarge/3.1 for a sarge release.
    - Sarge is going to have more than 9 CDs; make sure we clean up all of
      the working dirs.
    - Removed the -T option to mkisofs. We don't need the TRANS.TBL files
      any more, and we should save the space.
    - Added support for SIZE_MULT_x when calculating full disc
      sizes. Best use is on m68k and powerpc images where HFS hybrid
      metadata seems to add ~10% to the size of the image.
    - Various updates to update-cd to cope with changes r0->r2.
    - Updated copy of CONF.sh in debian directory to match the working copy in .
    - Small lintian fixes.
  * Raphael Hertzog
    - Add missing Build-Depends-Indep. Closes: #258018
    - Remove debian-keyring.tar.gz from the doc dir.
    - Don't include Contents-$ARCH.gz on netinst/businesscard CD.
  * Joey Hess
    - Include sarge installation manual on sarge CDs.
    - Remove install/doc, and just use doc/install.
    - Patch from Thiemo Seufer to add mips and mipsel kernels.
      Also, remove some packages from arches that do not need them.
    - Remove module-init-tools-udeb from the CD.
    - Remove raidtools2-udeb from the exclude list, while nothing depends on
      it, it can be handy for manually setting up raid.
    - discover has been renamed to discover1
    - On i386, include discover on the CD as well, this is discover verson
      2, and is used with the 2.6 kernel.
    - Based on user reports, remove the read-only, and pass "rw" to the kernel
      in silo.conf.
    - Include only 2.4 ia64 kernels on the d-i CD for now, the 2.6 ones
      are not a good choice ATM according to bdale.
    - silo.conf fixes.
    - Fix mirror_check to look under LOCALDEBS for files if it is set.
    - Add mdadm to the netinst CD, needed for software raid installs.
    - Add lvm2 (and dependencies libdevmapper1.00 and lvm-common)
      for new partman. Left lvm10 on the CD for now, remove later.
    - Add jfsutils to netinst cds.
    - Add usbutils to netinst cds, it'll be installed by a future version
      of hw-detect.
    - Add tools/get_diskusage.pl (originally by Petter).
    - Add update-popcon Makefile target (taken from Skolelinux).
    - Add a KERNEL_PARAMS variable, which can be used to add kernel parameters
      and is useful for creating things like CDs that install in critical
      priority mode. I only implemented it for i386 so far.
    - Add MAXCDS config variable, which forces debian-cd to stop after a given
      number of binary CDs.
    - Only exclude udebs from the CD that are in both the cd initrd and the
      hd-media initrd, since both use the CD. This adds back floppy-modules
      and firewire-core-modules.
    - Add new default udeb_include files (for to full CDs and DVDs) that
      include ethdetect and netcfg, to make network configuration happen in
      first stage, since the second stage cannot currently do any.
      Closes: #240458
    - Include debian-installer+kernel into Debian_sarge task to ensure all
      debs as well as udebs used by d-i are included.
    - Exclude newer versions of i386 kernels to save space. Leave 2.6.x-386
      kernels on the CD.
    - Update task-essential-sarge to tasksel 2.05. Fix the generator to work
      with post-2002 tasksels.
    - Update task-full-sarge and task.list to tasksel 2.05. The task.list was
      manually ordered to give desktop task priority, followed by servers,
      followed by languages.
    - NORECOMMENDS should be used for sarge official CD sets (getting full
      tasks is more important), and is on by default.
    - Add libfribidi0 to generate_di+k_list, needed for BIDI.
    - Switch CONF.sh to sarge.
    - Uncomment exclude lines.
    - Remove the boot.bat script and redundant and incorrect README.tools.
      The alternative is to maintain and document them.
    - Exclude kernel sources from popcon results, old data skews this badly.
    - Remove old kernel sources from interesting-fromcd23, and various other
      removals and updates.
    - Update the task lists and popcon again.
    - Stop excluding 686 and 686-smp kernels, as these are probably the most
      popular, and they fit on CD#1 now.
    - Add "--" end of installer kernel params markers to the isolinux.cfg.
  * Petter Reinholdtsen
    - Regenereated tasks/popularity-contest-sarge based on the current data.
    - Avoid kernel versions 2.4.24 and 2.6.3 on the first i386 CD, as we
      are currently using 2.4.25.
    - Remove packages not in testing from exclude-sarge.
    - Update list2cds to allow #-comments in the exclude file.
    - Try to create $(OUT) instead of just bailing out if it is missing.
    - Missing b-f documentation is not a fatal error.  Keep
      building if it is missing.
    - Make it possible to give different CONF.sh files to build.sh.
    - Make it possible to change which images to build using CONF.sh.
    - Use DI_CODENAME to locate the installation system.  This make it
      possible to use debian-installer with Woody CDs.
    - Avoid illegal dash (-) in cpp architecture defines.  Patch
      from Colin Watson.
  * Stephen R. Marenka
    - Update m68k support for sarge.
        - Fix m68k/amiga icons.
        - Add 2.2 kernel-based cdrom initrd.
        - Redo m68k subarch boot/install for sarge.
        - Bump all subarchs to 2.4 kernel, except mac.
        - Add bvme6000 boot code.
        - Workaround boot/install for non-DI_WWW_HOME case.
  * Santiago Garcia
    - Update isolinux.bin to the version we are shipping with Sarge.
    - Update debian-installer tasks.
    - Update boot scripts for sarge to be able to build cds using d-i
      images from the chosen dist using the mirror or from the web.
    - Add support for sarge bootable mips cds.
    - Add support for sarge bootable sparc cds.
    - Add kernel 2.6 on i386 cds, remove it from the exclusion list.
    - Add support for booting 2.6 as well as 2.4 to the first i386 cd.
    - Add dirty temporal workaround for saving space on netinst images.
      This should be fixed in a proper way when time permits.
    - Make fast_sums ignore md5sums of files not in the pool directory.
      Closes: #247889
    - Add support for sarge bootable mipsel cds (delo based), needs work.
    - Fix the dirty workaround bug that was adding debs to businesscards.
    - Add 2.6 support to powerpc cds.
    - Add yaboot to powerpc netinst cds as debootstrap no longer adds it.
    - Update boot-sparc not to depend on a kernel version.
    - Remove ramdisk_size param of silo.conf.
    - Add initrd-tools to sparc di+k list.
    - Generate PPC CD 1 with -chrp-boot. Closes: #252667
    - Increase max catalog size on PPC DVDs. Closes: #252652
  * Bdale Garbee
    - shorten the command line in post-boot-hppa for sarge, as palo can't
      handle a command line longer than 127 chars right now
  * Otavio Salvador
    - Preprocess exclude files much like tasks files are. Closes: #247379
    - Check if the missing debootstrap-required is not included on
      base_exclude.
    - Fix preprocess of exclude files when EXCLUDE is not set.
  * Kenshi Muto
    - Add floppy/asian-root.img and floppy/access/* as i386 disk image.
  * Colin Watson
    - Add exclude-udebs-powerpc list with packages already in the initrd,
      along the same lines as exclude-udebs-i386. Saves about 11 megabytes.
    - Add bootable CD support for arm, following Vince Sanders' advice.
    - Include kernel-image-2.4-* metapackages for ia64.
    - Unexclude zlib1g-udeb, needed for ssh support in d-i.
    - Make sure quik is on the powerpc netinst CD; debootstrap no longer
      installs it.
    - Bump initrd-size to 10MB for powerpc 2.4. Current d-i initrds exceed
      that.
    - Remove -safe options from powerpc yaboot menu, as they caused
      combinatorial explosion. Instead, document video=ofonly in boot.msg.
    - Clarify powerpc boot.msg a bit.
    - Cope with debian-installer powerpc image rearrangement.
  * Sven Luther
    - fixed powerpc list so it includes the 2.6 kernels too as well as the
      power3 and power4 2.4 kernels.
  * Steve Langasek
    - Add alpha and mipsel bootloaders to debian-installer+kernel,
      so debootstrap doesn't have to install them

 -- Raphael Hertzog <hertzog@debian.org>  Thu, 25 Mar 2004 07:33:23 +0100

debian-cd (2.2.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed debian/conffiles (useless with debhelper 4).
  * Added aptitude on netinst CD (but not on businesscard CD).
    Closes: #220125, #219986
    It is already on CD1 of a normal CD set.
  * Kenshi Muto
    - Add jfbterm, unifont into forcd1, d-i+kernel (second stage of
      debian-installer needs them).
    - Add console-cyrillic, console-terminus, hotplug, iso-codes into forcd1,
      d-i+kernel.
  * Joey Hess
    - Add "expert" mode to isolinux.cfg for sarge.
    - Remove pump-udeb from all udeb_includes; netcfg depends on and
      uses dhcp-client-udeb.
    - Add appropriate kernel-pcmcia-modules package to
      debian-installer+kernel task for i386.
    - Update the yaboot boot.msg to match the one in d-i cvs.
    - Update the yaboot.conf to add expert and expert-safe boot modes.
    - Link the d-i INSTALLATION-HOWTO into doc/, if it exists.
    - Add my exclude_udebs lists, for general and i386, and modify
      generate_di_list to not include udebs from those lists onto the
      cdrom, to save space on the netinst cds. Closes: #215469
    - Use the d-i docs in sid instead of the woody boot floppies docs.
    - Add pcmcia-cs-udeb to sarge's i386_netinst_udeb_include, to support
      pcmcia installs.
    - Remove console-keymaps from all udeb_includes; they are included
      on the cdrom initrds.
    - Switch from netcfg-static/dhcp to just netcfg.
    - Split udeb_includes for businesscard and netinst; netinst does not
      need choose-mirror, while businesscard does.
    - Add wireless-tool-udeb to udeb_include for i386 and powerpc netinst
      and businesscard images.
    - Add pcmcia-cs onto the generate-di+k_list, now that is is not
      autoinstalled by debootstrap.
    - Document vga=771 boot option for laptops with screen problems.
    - Add the debian-edu udebs to the exclude list for netinst CDs, and
      remove the deleted di-utils-devicefiles.
    - Update boot/sarge/boot-i386 to use the new d-i image names.
    - Use d-i boot screens from the debian-cd_info.tar.gz. 
      Closes: #220612, #221186
    - Remove the netboot initrd from netinst CDs, since d-i builds a mini-iso
      with this initrd on it, and since the d-i help screen does not mention
      the net type.
    - Add xfsprogs and reiserfsprogs to generate_di+k_list.
    - Add lilo as well; it's not autoinstalled by debootstrap, but
      lilo-installer still uses it.
    - Increase the i386 isolinux ramdisk size to 10 mb; it's grown due to
      translatons and all the scsi drivers.
    - Drop lowmemcheck from the CD; it is in the initrd.
    - Add wireless-tools to generate_d-i+k_list
    - Remove the old partitioner from the CD for i386. (This should also be
      done for other arches for which it is not default)
    - Include all the powerpc kernels that d-i's base-installer currently
      could try to install on the CD.
    - Try to include some sparc kernels on the CD; it's probably better than
      including none..
    - Revamped the README.html, removing the old manual apt setup
      instructions, various references to woody, fixing the link to the LDP
      home page, dropping reference to the basically dead non-us section,
      removing confusing references to non-free being on the CD, dropping
      references to dselect, etc.
    - Fix layout of README.txt, adding missing <p>'s after headings.
    - Drop README.mirrors and README.non-US from the CDs.
  * Steve Langasek
    - Add fdisk-udeb to the list of needed debs for alpha
    - Use /dev/ram as the root device for aboot (alpha)
  * Petter Reinholdtsen
    - Updated tasks/README with new location of popularity-contest results.
    - Regenereated tasks/popularity-contest-sarge based on the current
      data.
    - Avoid acorn-fdisk, cfdisk-utf8 and lots of kernels on the first CD.
      It should be enough with one kernel package on the first CD.
    - Make generated debian-installer list easier to read by adding
      arch info at the end of an #ifdef block.
  * Santiago Garcia
    - Add DI_CODENAME variable make it posible to build cds with a special
      debian-installer version.
    - Make Makefile remove dedication files except for current version.
    - Update debian-installer.* tasks
    - Add hppa kernels to generate_di+k_list
    - Add sarge boot scripts for hppa

debian-cd (2.2.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated standards-version to 3.6.0.
  * Use debhelper 4 (build-depends on it, updated DH_COMPAT).
  * WARNING: potato is now mostly unsupported, some cruft has been
    removed that may have been useful for generating potato CDs.
  * Added debian-installer support. debian-installer is automatically
    used if $MIRROR/dists/$CODENAME/main/debian-installer exists.
    (however you have to require the inclusion of the udeb via the
    task mechanism, cf tasks/debian-installer for the current list)
  * Added all files for sarge (in tasks/ data/ and tools/).
  * Updated isolinux.bin from syslinux 1.75-1.
  * Tollef Fog Heen:
    - Make it possible to exclude contrib from the CDs. Useful if you only
      have a mirror of main.
    - The names of the bootable images have changed on
      people.d.o/~tfheen/d-i/images/daily, update download scripts to reflect
      that.
  * Petter Reinholdtsen:
    - Add CONTRIB flag to debian/CONF.sh.
    - Add support for BASE_INCLUDE and BASE_EXCLUDE, making files
      cdrom/.disk/base_include and .../base_exclude used by
      debian-installer.
    - Document BOOTDISKS.
    - Make disk number available in tools/add-bin-doc.
    - In woody, keep the time stamp of smb.bin when copying it to CD.
    - Add support for UDEB_INCLUDE and UDEB_EXCLUDE, making files
      cdrom/.disk/udeb_include and .../udeb_exclude used by
      debian-installer.
  * Apply patch from Petter Reinholdtsen for inclusion of
    Recommends/Suggests from the base system. Closes: #106903
  * Apply nice patch from Santiago Garcia Mantinan for building
    "netinst CDs" !
  * Don't check dependencies for udebs, they tend to be broken
    and we still want them on the CD.
  * Put good default values for UDEB_INCLUDE based on the value of
    INSTALLER_CD.
  * Many updates on the tasks files by Josip Rodin. Removed useless packages
    from sarge CD1... and so on.
  * Updated hfs.map with .sit info (for powerpc arch). Closes: #186837

debian-cd (2.2.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply patch for mipsel boot support. Closes: #145318
    Thanks to Karsten Merker.
  * Updated README.sbm with more info provided by Santiago
    Marcia Mantinan.
  * Reordered some woody task files. Thanks to Philip Charles.
  * Added cpp in the Depends field. Closes: #145869
  * Fixed error message in Makefile. Closes: #146184
  * Updated tools/add_secured to work with all versions of md5sum
    (including the one that comes with dpkg >= 1.10).
  * Protect the call to add_secured by a stamp file. Closes: #147105
  * Provide a customised isolinux image. We don't need to
    recommend syslinux now.
  * Apply patch from Petter Reinholdtsen to put security updates on the cd.
  * Apply patch from Petter Reinholdtsen to preserve timestamps, making
    build.sh being able to run with -e set, report reserved space and
    the space debootstrap needs.  Also, handle boot-floppy directories
    without docs.
  * Make sure discover, read-edid and mdetect are on the first CD if
    possible.

debian-cd (2.2.14) unstable; urgency=high

  * Updated the script to update tasks/base-woody. Closes: #138651
  * Anne commited stuff for inclusion of a local security.debian.org.
  * Added NOSUGGESTS in a similar way than NORECOMMENDS. Thanks
    to Petter Reinholdtsen <pere@hungry.com>.
  * Added "decompacted language packs" to the bootable CDs.
    Closes: #139179
  * Corrected name of kernel s/linux/linux.bin/ (why the hell
    do they need to change that name now ...). Closes: #139503
    Change has been made for arches where the latest bf are
    available. More may need to come for arches like sparc
    which are catching up with bf.
  * More changes of kernel name in anticipation of the upcoming
    boot floppies for sparc & alpha.
  * Change the order of flavors in the i386 CD set. First is "idepci",
    second "compact", third "bf2.4" and fourth the old default one. At
    least we have the language chooser on the first CD but it's still
    2.2 based. Reworked the MULTIBOOT code to take this into account.
  * Added capability to generate DVD-sized images. Use bc to calculate
    disk sizes in build.sh and build_all.sh, and use the textutils
    version of md5sum to avoid missing large file support in dpkg
    version. Specify the output image sizes in CONF.sh
  * Added ISOLINUX code (export ISOLINUX=yes in CONF.sh); this provides a
    "rescue floppy like" boot screen that allows choosing between kernel
    images, rather than loading the rescue disks directly from the boot
    sector.
  * Removed obsolete local-variables section from changelog.
  * Added default values into CONF.sh for isolinux support.
  * Change again the order of the boot images for i386.
    1: multiboot (isolinux) 2: vanilla 3: compact 4: idepci 5: bf2.4
  * Put TERM=vt102 for vanilla flavor as it seems to fix the borders
    of the boxes in a few cases.
  * Improved the test to see if we want non-free. Instead of -n "$NONFREE"
    it's now "${NONFREE:-0}" != "0" (same for EXTRANONFREE). Maybe
    should we do the same for the other boolean environment variables like
    LOCAL, SECURITY, SECURED ...
  * Changed the test for ISOLINUX and MULTIBOOT to be coherent with the other
    boolean variables.
  * Dropped old el-torito multiboot support. Documented the choice of
    isolinux in README.devel.
  * added ramdisk_size=8192 to palo commandline for hppa
  * Added empty boot-mips & boot mipsel.
  * Updated boot-alpha to conditionalize the inclusion of APB.
  * Reworked boot-ia64 to use hardlinks and so 1_NONUS.raw is built properly.
  * Reworked post-boot-hppa to hardcode path to palo, and to ensure
    1_NONUS.raw is built properly.
  * Added Smart Boot Manager image for people who want to boot ISOLINUX
    image on machine with BIOS which don't support them.

  * Automatically add packages listed by local debootstrap. Closes: #131820
  * Adapted to new s390 boot-floppies 3.0.19 directory structure (Stefan
    Gybas <sgybas@debian.org>).
  * Updated boot-i386 for the boot-floppies 3.0.19.
  * Don't include the base-images-* directories on the CD. They
    are meant for people wishing to install by floppy (who download the
    floppy images from the net).
  * Corrected the priority to match the priority given in the override file.
  * CDs with .disk/kernel_installable have the disks-<arch> directories
    and those with .disk/base_installable have all the packages required
    by debootstrap.
  * Updated base-woody with debootstrap 0.1.17. Closes: #138357

  * All (i386) CD's now have a different kernel from boot-disks.
  * Updated pi-makelist, now excludes all of the sparc live filesystem.

  * Include upgrade-{i386,sparc,alpha,m68k} dir when available.
  * Updated README.html.in (new version provided by Anne Bezemer).

    The first CDs are totally free and the last(s) CD(s) contains 
    only non-free and possibly some files from contrib.
  * Added extra file to help fine tune the CD sizes per archs
  * Edited boot-alpha to work (I hope) based on what was available in the
    README.txt in boot-floppies

    modified imagesums/pi-makelist to support the subdirs
  * Added FORCENONUSONCD1 support - move all non-US packages/sources to
    CD#1 of the set. We then make 2 copies of this, one with non-US and
    one without. Useful for people wanting to create non-US and US-safe
    CDs without having to spend so much disk space.
  * Added patch from Joey Hess for LOCALDEBS support. Closes: #66447

debian-cd (2.1.92) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * This version goes to frozen since it's used for building potato CD.
    Another one will follow once we have the final boot-floppies.
    But I already upload this one because I'm getting complaints since
    the old package doesn't work with the actual boot-floppies available
    on the mirror...
  * Added files for woody (yes, people already burn woody CD images)
  * Make the second CD bootable on i386 with the "compact" image.
  * Changes to installtools.sh, change to check for documentation
    directory name by $ARCH.
    -> This change will have to be removed when all arch will have synced
    boot floppies.
  * Changes to tools/potato/boot-i386 for support of the 2.2.3 bootdisks.
    Closes: #53529 #58304
  * In Makefile, if there are multiple versions of the
    bootdisks in the source tree, the section "boot:" seems to get
    confused. Not fixed. Temporary solution, move old i386 boot
    disks out of the source archive.
  * Added a file tasks/popularity-contest listing packages by order of
    usefulness (results given by the popularity contest of course). This
    file is included at the end of the Debian_potato task in order to
    include the packages that are widely used on the first CD if possible.
  * Added a bunch of set -e.
  * Added pi-makelist target to generate the *.list files used by the
    Pseudo Image Kit. Needs isoinfo in the cdwrite package.
  * Updated README and README.devel. Explained that the main source
    is on CVS and that patch should apply on the CVS tree not on the
    source package available on the Debian FTP.
  * Added possibility to include local packages on the CD set. Documented
    it. Closes: #50640

  * Can now build CD with bootdisks taken from somewhere else than
    the mirror (allow you to use your own boot floppies, notably those
    built with translated documentation).
  * The documentation from the boot-floppies are now installed
    in /install and /doc by the scripts tools/$CODENAME/installtools.sh
    It was needed since the documentation of the boot-floppies does
    differ from one dist to another ...
  * Removed some cruft which is no more needed (master for potato,
    status.i386).
  * Updated README to explain that the mkhybrid package in Debian
    does support the -F option. Closes: #50141

  * YACS 0.5 :
  * ----------
  * tools/add_dirs: don't create section subdirectories for non-US.
  * tools/*: full slink compliance. Should build slink disk even with
    non-US. Thanks to the help of Filip Van Raemdonck <mechanix@dma.be>.
  * Makefile: added an upgrade target called when building

    Please test. In particular for non-i386 CD images. I want to check
    if the scripts to make CD bootables are (still) working.
  * tools/apt-selection: removed some bashisms.
  * Many data has been splitted by codename. This is to allow
    us to build slink and potato CD without much troubles.

  * YACS 0.4 :
  * ----------
  * New status file for potato i386.

    exist before.
  * Call dpkg-scansources for generating Sources.gz file on the source 
    CD. And depends on dpkg-dev (>= 1.4.1.6) to be sure that we have it.
  * Add dependency to libdigest-md5-perl.
  * list2cds: try to select all suggested/recommended packages not only from
    packages explicitely selectionned but also from packages listed
    in dependencies.
  * list2cds: many little checks added, now generates a log.list2cds
    file (in the temp dir).
  * YACS 0.3 :
  * ----------
  * This version has herited nothing from the previous debian-cd 
    package only the changelog has been added.
  * It can now build sources CD.
  * This package does now replace slink_cd and the old debian-cd.
    I'll close the bugs (after checking that the new debian-cd behaves
    correctly with the bug report situation) affected to those packages.
  * The Packages.cd files are generated correctly (the same way than
    slink_cd did).
  * Added the good dependencies. Closes: #25710, #36109, #27758
  * Some bugs are no more applicable. Closes: #24708, #25195, #31044, #24418
    Closes: #36115, #36228
  * No source URL in copyright file since this is a Debian native 
    package. Closes: #36111
  * Full GPL isn't included. Closes: #36113
  * Missing newlines added. Closes: #36114
  * The README is a good documentation for building CD. Closes: #17540
  * Added the support for hooks. Closes: #36112
  * Added a link index.html -> install.html. Closes: #38402
  * Files are better placed. Closes: #36110
  * Rebuilding the Contents file is of no use. And if you really need
    it, you can do it yourself with the hook system. Closes: #36116
  * Internationalization is a boot-floppies problem. Closes: #25210
  * Tried miniunz but it lacks important feature like -L ... still
    uses unzip. And recommends it.

debian-cd (1.99.14-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * This should really go in hamm, so that the scripts to build the CD's
    end up on the CD's.  Of course this will probably require a few attempts
    before the scripts here settle down, because other changes are still being
    made to hamm that affect these.
  * edit some README's and Configuration defaults.  Done with a -1 version
    so my diff's come out in the diff file
  * put the hamm --> ../hamm link back into dists
