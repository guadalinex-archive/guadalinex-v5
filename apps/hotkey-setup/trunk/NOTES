When the machine should be put to sleep in some fashion:

KEY_SLEEP signals Suspend to RAM (Suspend, technically called "standby")
KEY_SUSPEND signals Suspend to Disk (Hibernate, technically called "suspend"...)

KEY_MAIL is used in preference to KEY_EMAIL.

For functions that have not been assigned a named Linux kernel keycode,
with a value <=255, then the following aliases are used:

KEY_LOCK=$KEY_COFFEE
KEY_PRESENTATION=$KEY_F23

# This has been assigned 236 now
KEY_BATTERY=236

# Acer 1690, VGA toggle
KEY_VIDEOOUT=$KEY_F20

# Toshiba (and other) Tablets,
# the support to actually rotate the screen is only in very recent i810 drivers.
#KEY_ROTATESCREEN=$KEY_F21

# ThinkPad Fn+Spacebar (called "Zoom")
KEY_VIDEOMODECYCLE=$KEY_F22

# ThinkPad Fn+PgUp (called ThinkLight)
# On Apple laptop, under-keyboard lighting
KEY_LIGHT=$KEY_F19

# All the laptops except 1 Medion (Acer) I've seen using ACPI for the wifikey hotkey.
#KEY_WIFI=$KEY_CONNECT

Avoiding remapping already mapped hotkeys.  'atkbd.hk' contains a list of the keycodes
and KEY_NAME mappings used by the 'drivers/input/keyboard/atkbd.c' driver at boot-time.
This may be useful as a reference and for grepping out entries that don't actually need
to be matched.

  awk '/^setkeycodes/{x=strtonum("0x"$2);if(x>127)x-=(0xe000-128);sub("^.","",$3);print$3"="x }' *.hk \
  | xargs -d"\n" -n1 grep -c < key-constants | grep -cv 0
