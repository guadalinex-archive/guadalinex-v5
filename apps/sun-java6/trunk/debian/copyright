     FAQ for the Operating System Distributor License for Java (DLJ)

The purpose of this FAQ is to provide some insight into Sun's thoughts
in creating the Operating System Distributor License for Java. 
Although the FAQ is not a legal document, it is designed to illustrate 
the license terms through explanation and examples. This is a well
accepted way of helping non-lawyers attain some comfort with legal
language, which is crafted by attorneys to meet the arcane 
requirements of statutes and judicial opinions. For example, 
Creative Commons does a similar thing with its "Deeds," 
(e.g. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/ ) which are 
human-readable summaries of the "Legal Code" 
(e.g. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/legalcode ) and
and are accompanied by a legal disclaimer
( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/disclaimer-popup?lang=en-us ).

If you think our FAQ is contradicted by the language in the license,
we'd like to hear from you so that we can consider revising the
license to clear up any confusion. Otherwise, we encourage you to
think of the FAQ as a series of guideposts designed to help you
understand and work with the license terms. Of course, if Sun clearly
says in an FAQ that it's okay to do something (and we haven't made a
blatant typographical error), we're not going to sue you -- even if
one could make a clever legal argument that the license doesn't permit
it. We believe in simplicity and transparency, and pledge to work
diligently with the community to achieve those objectives.

Sun expects to periodically update this FAQ to better reflect the
concerns and questions of the developer community. You will find a
pointer to the latest version of this FAQ at:
  https://jdk-distros.dev.java.net/developer.html 

1.  What is the Operating System Distribution License for Java
    (a.k.a. the "Distro License for Java" or DLJ)?

    The DLJ is a license created specifically for individuals and
    communities who want to distribute Sun's binary Java Development
    Kit (JDK) or Java Runtime Environment (JRE) with a Linux or
    OpenSolaris Operating System (OS) distribution.

2.   Why is Sun releasing the DLJ?

    It's been difficult for developers who want to use Java SE
    technology on a broad choice of Linux or OpenSolaris distributions
    to easily obtain and use Sun's JDK or JRE. One issue has been the
    redistribution terms of the Binary Code License (BCL) for Java SE
    technology, which was never intended to license these bits for
    general distribution with an Operating System. With this new
    license, Sun is enabling the developer community to distribute our
    binary JDK and JRE with distributions of Linux or OpenSolaris
    operating systems, while still maintaining compatibility with the
    Java Specifications.

3.  How do I become a "DLJ Licensee?"

    The DLJ is distributed by Sun as a "click-through license" in
    special bundles available on java.net in the jdk-distros project
    at https://jdk-distros.dev.java.net . These bundles contain the
    same JDK software found in the standard Linux distribution bundles
    and the Solaris bundles in the download area on java.sun.com
    except that the LICENSE and README file are replaced by the DLJ
    and a modified README file with matching terms. The README file
    included in these bundles allows you to create JRE distributions
    from the JDK bundles by following instructions in the file.

4.  What does the DLJ allow me to do?

    You can: 
    - Use the JDK on your OS to design, develop, test, and run Java programs. 
    - Repackage the JDK for use with your OS, within the limitations
      spelled out in the README file.
    - Distribute the JDK on any media, online, and preinstalled on
      systems as a package with your OS.
    - Distribute the JDK directly, or indirectly through your
      licensees, distributors, resellers, OEMs, or downstream
      recipients of your OS.

5.  When I exercise the license and distribute the JDK, does it become
    part of my Operating System, or do I need to explicitly declare it
    as part of my OS?

    No - the license grants you the right to distribute the JDK with
    your Operating System, but it is still a separate piece of
    software. You do not need to make the JDK part of what you define
    as your OS when you exercise the license. All you need to do to
    exercise the license is distribute the JDK with your OS. For
    example, you could distribute the JDK bundles on a CD with your
    OS, or in a package repository for your OS on your mirror
    distribution sites.

6.  Can projects such as the JPackage Project exercise the DLJ?

    Sun recognizes and encourages the contributions of projects such
    as the JPackage Project ( http://www.jpackage.org ) to the adoption
    of Java technology on GNU/Linux OSs. Such projects are very
    similar to the jdk-distros project that Sun has established,
    providing recommendations for packaging Java technology with OS
    distributions, but not actually distributing an OS. Anyone can
    provide recommendations for packaging under the DLJ, but only
    GNU/Linux and OpenSolaris OS distributors may exercise the DLJ and
    ship the JDK, as the license requires that you ship the JDK
    bundles with an OS.

7.  I distribute my OS online from multiple mirror sites. Does such a
    multi-site online distribution model fit into the definition of
    "online" under this license?

    Yes it does. Each mirror is, in essence, a downstream distributor
    of the original OS bundles from the master site. Accordingly, the
    mirror sites may distribute the JDK as part of these bundles,
    under the terms and conditions of the DLJ.

8.  What are my obligations under this license?

    The license is the best reference for this. Some of the important 
    terms to consider are that you are required to:
    - Keep all copyright and other notices intact.
    - Distribute the entire JDK - no subsetting. Note - the README
      file has the specifics of what you must distribute, and what can
      be omitted.
    - Use the JDK only to design, develop, test, and run Java programs
      on your OS - you may not use it or parts of it for other
      purposes.
    - Present for acceptance any end user licenses that are part of
      the JDK, if such licenses are included in the generic install
      bundle provided to you for repackaging.
    - Redistribute subject to the DLJ - so that downstream users and
      distributors of the JDK are also subject to the DLJ's terms.
    - Indemnify Sun against claims arising from your OS or your
      violation of the DLJ (or any applicable law) Note that you are
      not responsible for changes made to your OS distribution by
      downstream users or distributors when such changes are out of
      your control.
    - Ship only a compatible JDK on your OS. If notified of an
      incompatibility, you must correct it and offer a patch or
      replacement to downstream recipients within 90 days, or stop
      shipment and notify downstream recipients.

9.  What is the README file? Is it part of the license? Why not include 
    it with the rest of the license?

    The README file is explicitly called out in Section 2. License
    Grant as a document that provides specific exceptions and
    restrictions to what you may distribute, and should be considered
    an adjunct to the license. The reason for keeping these details in
    a separate file is simple: it allows us to adjust the technical
    details of what constitutes the "Software" and what parts may be
    redistributed separately or omitted from a distribution without
    revising the license itself. This allows us to more quickly react
    to clarify allowable modifications as additional distributions
    package the JDK and discover modifications that are required to
    ensure compatibility and quality.

    You will find a pointer to the latest version of the README at:
    https://jdk-distros.dev.java.net/developer.html

10. May I redistribute the src.zip file?

    This is one of the files listed in the README as being optional,
    but redistributable, so yes.

11. If I am working on alternative technology projects, will I be
    "tainted" by the existence of the src.zip file on my system, or if
    I open this file and examine its contents?

    No. The source in src.zip is licensed as a reference for running,
    designing, developing and testing Java applications, and is an
    integral and useful component of the JDK. Sun maintains that you
    aren't tainted simply by having looked at this code, or having it
    on your hard drive.

12. How do I ensure that my package reproduces all the right copyright 
    notices and proprietary legends as required in Section 2(a)?

    If you make certain that any copyright notices and licenses for
    the packaging are clearly separate from the notices for the Java
    platform, you'll be fine. Just make sure you distribute all the
    notices that are provided as part of the JDK bundles you are
    repackaging. For example in the 1.5.0 bundles, the notices are in
    the following files in the top level directory:

    COPYRIGHT
    LICENSE
    THIRDPARTYLICENSEREADME.txt

    These files are the copyright notice for the JRE or JDK packages,
    the license terms (DLJ) for the JRE or JDK packages and the
    copyright notices and license terms for the THIRD PARTY CODE,
    respectively.

13. Can I use the JDK to develop programs that can be run anywhere,
    or only for my OS? Section 2(b) seems to say I can't use the JDK
    for developing arbitrary Java language applications.

    The license allows you and your users to run Java programs from
    any source, and develop Java programs for any platform. If you
    distribute the JDK under this license, you must distribute it with
    your OS, and for the purpose of running and developing Java
    programs on your OS. The DLJ does not give you the right to
    distribute a "naked" version of the JDK without your OS. The
    purpose of the language in 2(b) is to require that you include
    your OS, and to use the JDK only for its normal intended purpose
    of running and developing Java programs.

14. Does this license prevent me shipping any alternative technologies 
    in my OS distribution? 

    The DLJ does not restrict you from shipping any other technologies
    you choose to include in your distribution. However, you can't use
    pieces of the JDK configured in conjunction with any alternative
    technologies to create hybrid implementations, or mingle the code
    from the JDK with non-JDK components of any kind so that they run
    together. It is of course perfectly OK to ship programs or
    libraries that use the JDK. Because this question has caused
    confusion in the past, we want to make this absolutely clear:
    except for these limitations on combining technologies, there is
    nothing in the DLJ intended to prevent you from shipping
    alternative technologies with your OS distribution.

15. So, can I ship Eclipse, or other language implementations like 
    Perl or Python?

    Sun can't give you permission to ship these technologies. Only the
    lawful owners and licensors of those technologies can do that. The
    DLJ doesn't prohibit you from shipping them or from running them.

16. If some program in my OS specifies the option -Xbootclasspath to
    the java command, is that considered a breach of Section 2(c)?

    We realize there is some confusion about this because the
    documentation for the java command at
    http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/solaris/java.html
    makes specific mention of the Binary Code License (BCL). The
    intent of Section 2(c) is not to restrict what end user programs
    do with command line options but rather to ensure that the Sun
    Java platform is not used to create hybrid implementations with
    alternate technologies, or mingle the JDK code with alternate
    technologies so they run together.

17. What do you mean by "Present for acceptance end user licenses"
    (from #8 above)? Do I have to create a click-through license
    display when a user first installs or runs the JDK? Must my users
    accept the license?

    Your users must agree to the license terms for the JDK before
    installing it. While you aren't required to show the DLJ on first
    use or installation, you must inform them that the JDK is licensed
    software and that they must agree to the license before using
    it. A click-through mechanism is the preferred way to do this, but
    at a minimum you must present the license by some appropriate
    means for acceptance. For example, your OS download procedure
    could show the user a page that informs him or her that software
    packages included in the download may contain software licenses to
    which the user must agree before installation, and allow the user
    to review them before download.

    You can leverage your distribution's packaging technology to
    ensure that the license terms have been accepted. For instance, on
    Debian and derivative distributions, you could configure the
    package so that if the debconf key for accepting the DLJ has not
    been pre-accepted, the installation will be canceled if the
    license cannot be presented. The point of presenting the license
    is that an individual, corporation, non-profit or entity which
    will be an end user of the JRE or JDK has had a chance to review
    and agree to the DLJ. If the user or administrator pre-accepts
    the key for DLJ agreement on behalf of herself or her group then
    it is perfectly acceptable to silently install Sun Java on one or
    many computers. This is an excellent example of how you can
    leverage packaging infrastructure to comply with the terms of the
    DLJ in ways that are convenient and expected for your users.

18. How do I redistribute the JDK in my OS, so that downstream
    recipients are subject to the DLJ? Do I need to do anything
    special?

    Nothing special - just be sure to include the license in your JDK
    bundle, and inform your downstream recipients that the JDK is
    subject to the license when they download or install it.

19. What obligations do I assume when I receive the JDK as part of an
    OS distribution, and then turn around and redistribute it, even if
    I don't change a thing?

    When you redistribute the JDK under the DLJ, you are subject to
    its terms. This means that you are granted the rights described in
    the license (provided you remain in compliance with the license
    terms) and assume its obligations, including compatibility
    requirements and indemnification. It doesn't matter whether you
    change the distribution you receive or not. When you redistribute,
    you do so under the terms of the DLJ.

20. Why does Sun ask for indemnification? What indemnification am I
    providing to Sun? I'm concerned that I will be held responsible
    for things over which I have no control.

    Simply put, Sun requires indemnification to limit its exposure for
    issues that are not Sun's fault. If your conduct or your OS
    causes a problem that results in a third-party claim, then Sun
    expects you to take responsibility for it. Note that you are not
    indemnifying Sun against claims that are a result of something in
    Sun's code. You also are not indemnifying Sun against claims due
    to changes that a downstream distributor has made to your OS.

    Since downstream distributors must redistribute the JDK under the
    terms of the DLJ, they are the ones providing indemnification to
    Sun for the changes they've made to your OS - which is now their
    OS for the purposes of this license.

21. What do you mean by "compatible"?

    "Compatible" has a very specific meaning for Java technology, and
    in this license. Specifically, a "Compatible" Implementation" is
    an implementation of the Java SE technology specification that
    meets the requirements of the Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK).,
    i.e., the compliance tests, tools and documentation which allows
    you to establish whether a particular implementation completely
    and correctly implements the Java SE Specification on a specific
    host platform.

22. Am I required to run the TCK before I distribute the software?

    No, this license does not require that you run the TCK.

23. How do I learn more about the TCK?

    There is a "read-only" version of the Java SE TCK available at
    https://jck.dev.java.net which you can look at to better
    understand the compatibility requirements. The license for this
    is for evaluation purposes only.

24. How do I verify compatibility when I don't have the TCK?

    The DLJ is a binary redistribution license, for a binary that has
    been verified on Sun's supported OS platforms (see
    http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/system-configurations.html ).
    However, it is possible that the combination of Sun's JDK with
    your OS distribution could break compatibility. The jdk-distros
    project was created as a place for Linux, OpenSolaris, and Java
    developers to cooperate on creating new packaging for the JDK,
    solving problems including compatibility issues, and as a
    clearinghouse for best practices, tips and tricks, examples, and
    solutions to common issues. This project includes helpful guides
    to potential problems with compatibility based on Sun's experience
    in creating JDK bundles for supported OS versions. You can use
    this guide to help you discover potential problems before you
    distribute the JDK with your OS.

25. I'd like to test my OS distribution's compatibility. How do I 
    obtain the TCK?

    The TCK is available under a usage license that includes some
    support, and which may be purchased from Sun.

    If you are a qualified not-for-profit organization, you may be
    eligible to obtain the TCK under a scholarship. You can find more
    information about this program and request a scholarship
    application at: http://java.sun.com/scholarship/

    There is a "read-only" version of the Java SE TCK available at
    http://jck.dev.java.net which you can look at to better understand
    the compatibility requirements. The license for this is for
    evaluation purposes only and while it does not allow you to run
    the TCK, it may be helpful in your understanding of its
    requirements.

26. What happens if my OS does not behave compatibly with the JDK?

    Sun provides JDK bundles which have been qualified as compatible
    on several common Linux distributions and on
    Solaris. Incompatibility problems will typically be the result of
    variations between your OS and common distributions. Accordingly
    you should fix any problems you are aware of in your OS before
    distributing the software. The JDK must behave in a compatible
    manner when running on your OS.

27. If I'm aware of problems, can I document them for my users 
    and ship anyway?

    No, you must fix the problems before distributing the software. It
    is worth noting however, that you may document supported and
    unsupported platform configurations such as specific web browsers,
    OS versions, or hardware devices.

28. What if a problem comes up after I distribute the software?

    If Sun becomes aware of a compatibility problem with the JDK
    software on your OS distribution and notifies you about it, then
    you must fix the problem and offer a patch or new version to your
    downstream users and distributors, or stop distributing the
    software within 90 days of being notified. If you stop
    distributing the software, you must also make reasonable attempts
    to notify your users, and anyone who might have downloaded your OS
    distribution. Once your downstream users are notified, they must
    make the same choice (i.e. fix the problem or stop
    using/distributing the software)

    Remember, you are always allowed to discontinue distribution of
    the JDK and make a reasonable attempt to notify your downstream
    users and distributors. For example you can stop shipping Sun Java
    by removing it from the list of currently available software for
    your OS. Sun will consider a stop-ship action to be a suitable
    remedy for any compatibility problems. If at some future time you
    are able to fix the problem, you can resume distribution of the
    JDK under the terms of the DLJ.

29. If I decide to stop-ship, must I remove the JDK from archived and 
    compatible distribution bundles as well?

    No, archived bundles can contain the JDK as long as there are no
    compatibility issues. Removing the JDK from your active
    distribution should be sufficient. For instance, on Debian and
    derivative operating systems, you could remove the Sun Java
    packages from the tag database so that users can no longer install
    them using the conventional method (e.g. apt-get install
    sun-java5-jre).

30. What does Section 12, Export Regulations, mean?

    As a U.S. company, Sun is obligated to comply with U.S. export
    regulations --as well as the regulations of other countries where
    it does business or ships to. One way we comply with this
    obligation is to bring these laws and regulations to your
    attention. Ultimately you are responsible for ensuring that your
    use and distribution of the Software is in accordance with export
    regulations, as well as any other applicable laws.

31. May I use the Java logo to show that I'm including the JDK in my 
    OS distribution? What may I do with Java logos?

    No, you may not use the logo, as the right to use the logo is
    based on acquiring a TCK license and passing the TCK. You may
    state that you include the JDK as part of your description of your
    distribution. This license does not grant any right to use any Sun
    mark or logo.

32. What notification must I give Sun before distributing the JDK?

    You are not required to notify Sun, or register. You might find it
    useful however to post something in the jdk-distros project forums
    so that others interested in similar OS distributions to yours can
    share their experiences with you and you can collaborate with them
    on common issues and solutions.

33. Who can I contact if I have additional questions or comments?

    You can send questions related to the DLJ to DLJfeedback@sun.com
    and/or post comments on the jdk-distros project forums on
    java.net, at http://forums.java.net/jive/forum.jspa?forumID=94 .

34. Is it okay to use Jython with the JDK?

    The license does not prohibit the use or inclusion of external
    classfiles, such as Jython, in a operating system distribution 
    which includes the JDK.

          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31 2002.

This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license 
can be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that 
ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated 
version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". Otherwise, 
this version is the same as the previous version and is written so as to 
preserve the Free Software Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility and 
OSI's certification under the Open Source Definition. Please see our 
Copyright FAQ for common questions about using materials from our site,

Common Unix Printing System API Libraries (CUPS API library); 
Use of any of this software is governed by the terms of the license below: 
             
 GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.
