partman-auto-loop (0ubuntu11) gutsy; urgency=low

  * Use $mount_move for existing mountpoints too (thanks, Agostino Russo).

partman-auto-loop (0ubuntu10) gutsy; urgency=low

  * Call dh_installdebconf.
  * Use an existing mountpoint for /host if there is one.
  * Prevent ntfs-3g processes from being killed by /etc/init.d/sendsigs.

partman-auto-loop (0ubuntu9) gutsy; urgency=low

  * Remove the 'mountpoint' file for the partition mounted on /host so that
    we don't try to mount it again later and get confused.
  * Create sparse files for now. This is probably not ideal as they will
    tend to fragment and this won't preallocate space, but the installer
    experience is intolerable at the moment as it takes so long to dd
    /dev/zero over the whole file.

partman-auto-loop (0ubuntu8) gutsy; urgency=low

  * Use 'mount --move' outside d-i rather than 'mount -o move';
    inconveniently, util-linux doesn't like the latter, and busybox doesn't
    like the former.
  * Actually write the size to the partition's 'size' file, not the type!

partman-auto-loop (0ubuntu7) gutsy; urgency=low

  * Read all output from fstab.d scripts; exiting early causes very strange
    errors due to fstab.d scripts not making it to close_dialog before the
    next one starts.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 20 Sep 2007 11:40:27 +0100

partman-auto-loop (0ubuntu6) gutsy; urgency=low

  * Skip any zero-sized partitions resulting from recipe expansion.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 17 Sep 2007 11:07:44 +0100

partman-auto-loop (0ubuntu5) gutsy; urgency=low

  * Create ordinary swap files rather than creating swap partitions on top
    of loop devices.
  * apt-install lupin-support.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 07 Sep 2007 12:48:41 +0100

partman-auto-loop (0ubuntu4) gutsy; urgency=low

  * Bail out if any of the specified image paths already exist.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 29 Aug 2007 15:04:50 +0100

partman-auto-loop (0ubuntu3) gutsy; urgency=low

  * Priority: standard to match overrides.
  * Add finish.d script to create a /target/host mountpoint.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 30 Jul 2007 18:03:49 +0100

partman-auto-loop (0ubuntu2) gutsy; urgency=low

  * Never use more than 90% of the host filesystem.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 30 Jul 2007 14:39:43 +0100

partman-auto-loop (0ubuntu1) gutsy; urgency=low

  * Initial release. Not as well-integrated as one might like, as there's no
    way to create individual loopback mounts in partman at the moment.
