console-setup (1.21ubuntu1) hardy; urgency=low

  * Resynchronise with Debian. Remaining changes:
    - Use keymapper to generate decision trees for a restricted subset of
      the pc105 model.
    - If the detect-keyboard debconf plugin is available
      (cdebconf-newt-detect-keys in the installer), then offer to use it to
      detect the keyboard layout.
    - Reset console-setup/toggle to the default if it's set to "No toggling"
      and you select a non-Latin layout.
    - Change the default font from Terminus to VGA where supported.
    - Run kbd_mode on each tty in ACTIVE_CONSOLES rather than on the current
      tty, since the current tty might belong to X and changing X's tty out
      of raw mode is a very bad idea.
    - Automatically save the font and keymap to /etc in
      /etc/init.d/console-setup if it isn't being run from init. Similarly,
      ensure that the font and keymap are saved to /etc during initial
      installation.
    - Disable workaround in ckbcomp for the kernel not applying Caps Lock to
      non-ASCII letters, except for Turkish layouts; the cure is worse than
      the disease because it makes Caps Lock equivalent to Shift Lock.
    - Set keymap and font in the initramfs if possible.
    - Set default variant for French to oss.
    - Fix handling of commas in layout and variant names.
    - Fix keymap reduction not to try to express keymap A in terms of keymap
      B when B includes keys not mapped by A.
    - debian/config.proto: Set sparc default model to pc105.
    - Remove 'exit 0' from the end of debian/config.proto; this will be
      sourced from the postinst in the installer, and exiting in the
      successful case means that /etc/default/console-setup never gets
      generated.
    - Switch back to console-tools-udeb for now.
    - Stop running debconf-updatepo on clean.
  * Update for new layouts and variants for Japan, Montenegro, and Serbia,
    and migrate configuration files from the old layouts.

  * Improve ckbcomp(1) formatting.
  * Run setupcon with --save in the postinst to ensure that required data is

  [ Debconf templates translations ]
  * Belarusian. Closes: #447109
  * Galician. Closes: #447940

  * Correct "Provides:" in console-setup init script to allow insserv
    to insert console-setup properly in the boot sequence.
    Thanks to Petter Reinholdtsen for the patch. Closes: #458486
  * Add the required "Default-Stop" and "Required-Stop" fields in the
    init.d/console-setup script.
  * Set myself as Uploader.
  * Fixing lintian warnings:
    - Remove "perl, libxml-parser-perl" from Build-Depends. They were
      duplicated in Build-Depends-Indep
    - Do not ignore non-zero exit status of "make maintainer-clean" in the
      clean target
    - Turn console-setup/dont_ask_layout into an error template. That'll
      get rid of the lintian warning and this is more accurate anyway.
  * Fixing lintian errors:
    - No longer install an example file in 
      /usr/share/doc/console-setup-mini/examples/console-setup
      for the udeb package

    I disabled the code for making UTF-8 default charmap in d-i because
    there are locales which use other charmap.  However I made setupcon to

    Watson:
    - Do not sorce the debconf library in the middle of the postinst,
      closes: #420831.
    - Remove from the source package several directories
      debian/UDEB-PACKAGE-NAME.  (The udebs were removed from
      debian/control before running the clean target.)  Closes: #420912.
    - Map fr_CH locale to Swiss French default keyboard
      layout in config.proto.  Closes: #420828.
    - Pass xkbdir variable on the make-command line, because else its
      value is overriden and the keymap definitions in Keyboard/ckb are
      used.  Closes: #420827.
    - A new option --save-only for setupcon.
    - Ship KeyboardNames.pl and kbdnames-maker.  Closes: #420914.
    - Fix Esperanto locale check in config.proto, closes: #420785.  Make
      'epo' the default layout for Esperanto.
    - The Bosnian layout is 'ba', not 'bs'.  Closes: #420787.
    - The layout variant is 'deva', not 'dev'.  Closes: #420797.
    - Do not leave empty default codeset for unsupported locales.
      Closes: #420802.  
    - Use 'jp(latin)' instead of 'us' in the Latin mode of Japanese
      keyboards.  Override the keyboard model if it was chosen by default
      and the layout is Japanese or Brasilian.  Closes: #420824.
    - Add --save-only option to setupcon.  Closes: #420832.
    - Multiply the Installer-Menu-Item field of the udebs by 100.
      Closes: #421260.
    - By default do not use AltGr with basic US keyboard.  Closes: #421263.
    - Make sure amiga, ataritt, sun4 and sun5 are in KeyboardNames.pl even
      if they are not in the xml database.  Closes: #420821.
    - Talk about 'national' instead of 'non-Latin' mode in the templates.
      Treat the Lithuanian keyboard as a two-mode keyboard similarly to
      the Serbian keyboard.  Closes: #421261.
  * Do not ignore the Control+ and Alt+non_symbol_key combinations.
    Thanks to Karsten Hilbert, closes: #421796.
  * Two additions to the FAQ:
    - Add a suggestion for the VBERestore option.  Thanks to Dmitry
      Semyonov, closes: #402143.
    - Document CapsLock working as ShiftLock in Unicode mode.

  * Add a --save-only option to setupcon, to save the keyboard/font on the

  * Back out part of setup-console-under-usplash changes: attempts to change
    the font must be guarded against being run while on an X display or
    while usplash is running, because some kernel console drivers (at least
    vgacon) are fundamentally unable to change the font only on some virtual
    consoles, and will corrupt video memory if you try (LP: #73955). We now
    use setupcon --save-only to make sure the font is available on the root
    filesystem for the next boot but don't load it immediately.

console-setup (1.13ubuntu1) feisty; urgency=low

  * Resynchronise with Debian. Remaining changes:
    - Use keymapper to generate decision trees for a restricted subset of
      the pc105 model.
    - If the detect-keyboard debconf plugin is available
      (cdebconf-newt-detect-keys in the installer), then offer to use it to
      detect the keyboard layout.
    - Ship KeyboardNames.pl and kbdnames-maker in /usr/share/console-setup.
    - Only default to Canadian layout for fr_CA; use U.S. English for other
      *_CA locales.
    - Fix default layout for Bosnian and default variant for Hindi.
    - Set default charmap for d-i to UTF-8.
    - Remove unhelpful defaults for several questions.
    - Adjust the default keyboard model for Brazilian and Japanese layouts.
    - Allow preseeding of console-setup/modelcode, console-setup/layoutcode,
      console-setup/variantcode, console-setup/optionscode, and
      console-setup/fontsize.
    - Use jp(latin),jp rather than us,jp by default for Japanese.
    - Reset console-setup/toggle to the default if it's set to "No toggling"
      and you select a non-Latin layout.
    - Change the default font from Terminus to VGA where supported.
    - Skip now-unnecessary console check in init scripts.
    - Fix up font face and size on upgrading from old versions in Edgy.
    - Add a few bits of installer integration to console-setup-udeb borrowed
      from kbd-chooser.
    - console-setup Depends: perl; something in ckbcomp is causing perl to
      'use utf8' implicitly, and some of the necessary modules aren't in
      perl-base.
    - Run kbd_mode on each tty in ACTIVE_CONSOLES rather than on the current
      tty, since the current tty might belong to X and changing X's tty out
      of raw mode is a very bad idea.
  * Restore udeb generation.

  * Map fr_CH to ch(fr) (Swiss French).
  * Include ch(fr) in keymap tree.
  * Fix codeset question priority for Esperanto.
  * Remove X and usplash checks in keyboard-setup and console-setup init
    scripts, since neither are needed following the fix in console-setup
    1.7ubuntu19.
  * Allow setupcon to be run on install again, for the same reason.
  * Automatically save the font and keymap to /etc in
    /etc/init.d/console-setup if it isn't being run from init; this allows
    us to tolerate XKB data being moved to /usr. Similarly, ensure that the
    font and keymap are saved to /etc during initial installation.

console-setup (1.7ubuntu19) edgy; urgency=low

  * If upgrading from an older version than this one, check for the Terminus
    font face and change it to VGA (if you do like it, you can change it
    back and it won't be touched again). If Terminus was in use, also check
    for the 12x6 font size and change it to 16, since that was apparently
    selected due to a strange use-of-debconf bug.
  * Run kbd_mode on each tty in ACTIVE_CONSOLES rather than on the current
    tty, since the current tty might belong to X and changing X's tty out of
    raw mode is a very bad idea (closes: Malone #66929; requires kbd 1.12-15

  * Update debian-installer/keymap handling from trunk (Anton Zinoviev).
    Drop /etc/X11/xorg.conf upgrade handling, also per trunk, as I've been
    convinced that that is much less safe due to the prevalence of GNOME/KDE
    keymap overrides, and furthermore it made it more difficult to have
    ubiquity tell console-setup just to guess a default from the locale.
  * Drop the priority of the model and layout questions to medium if a
    configuration file already exists, since they'll have been asked at
    medium first time round and if we then ask them at critical the second
    time round they will be unexpectedly shown (closes: Malone #59883).

  * Changes in the text of some questions: "What is the origin of our
    keyboard" instead of "What is the layout of your keyboard" and "What
    is the layout of your keyboard" instead of "What is the variant of
    your keyboard".  Ask the console-setup/variant question with critical
    priority.  Thanks to Arnt Karlsen, closes: #352405.
  * Fix the true/yes discrepancy in setupcon which caused the options -k
    and -f not to work.
  * Updated Bulgarian translation.
