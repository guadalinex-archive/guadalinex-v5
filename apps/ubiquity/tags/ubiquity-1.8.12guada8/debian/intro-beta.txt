This is a beta version of the Ubuntu live CD installer. It is not a final release; that will come with the final release of Ubuntu 6.06 in June 2006.

It may be necessary to resize partitions on your hard disk during the installation process. While this procedure has been tested, there may still be bugs, so be sure to <b>take a full backup of any valuable data</b> before running this program.
