#  which you know hosts at least one Ubuntu FTP mirror. Please check
#  that the country really has an Ubuntu FTP mirror before putting a
#  random value here
#
#  First check that the country you mention here is listed in
#  http://cvs.debian.org/ *checkout* /webwml/english/mirror/Mirrors.masterlist?rev=HEAD\&cvsroot=webwml&content-type=text/plain
#  (remove the spaces between "*" and "/")

#  You should even NOT put square brackets in translations:
#  msgid "GB[ Default value for ftp]"
#  msgstr "FR"
