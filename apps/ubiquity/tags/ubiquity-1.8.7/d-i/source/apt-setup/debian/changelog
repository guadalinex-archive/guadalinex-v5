  * Resynchronise with Debian. Remaining changes:
    - Install the Ubuntu mirror generator instead of Debian's.
    - Set apt-setup/security_host to security.ubuntu.com, or
      ports.ubuntu.com on ports architectures; adjust directory and
      distribution to match.
    - Add security sources for restricted, universe, and multiverse,
      commented out unless the respective components are enabled. Disable
      security generator checks for contrib and non-free.
    - For CD installs, leave the sources.list created by apt-setup in
      /etc/apt/sources.list.apt-setup, and restore the sources.list created
      during base installation for the rest of the installation.
    - Honour OVERRIDE_BASE_INSTALLABLE when checking
      /cdrom/.disk/base_installable.
    - Enable universe and multiverse by default.
    - If either restricted or multiverse is enabled, add commented-out lines
      for the partner archive.
    - Reduce the mirror verification timeout to 10 seconds.
  * Use archive.ubuntu.com as the default source mirror for ports
    architectures.
  * Disable the volatile service for Ubuntu, and don't ask the
    apt-setup/services-select question.
  * Always disable the CD at the end of installation if no mirrors are
    present, even if it's a complete CD. These days it's more irritating
    than not, and inserting the CD on a desktop system will produce a prompt
    anyway.
  * Default to not using a mirror if the user selected to not configure the
    network in netcfg (copied from Debian mirror generator).
  * Set Vcs-Bzr for Ubuntu.

apt-setup (1:0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * First release as a udeb broken out from base-config and rewritten.

  * This means that apt mirror config uses d-i's mirror configs automatically.
    Closes: #220269, #252121, #235980, #251007
  * Issues with /dev/cdrom symlinks no longer apply, since that's taken
    care of by d-i. Closes: #198759, #264375, #274615
  * Issues with CD eject buttons no longer apply, since well, it currently
    only supports loading in one CD. Closes: #215639, #215639, #240331
    Closes: #333513
    (TODO item exists for multiple CDs tho).
  * Runs in the first stage so no issues with it running again and eating
    configured sources or wanting to clear proxy settings.
    Closes: #229048, #196625
  * Will deal nicely with failure to reach security.debian.org.
    Closes: #251413
  * You can enter a mirror manually in choose-mirror and entry proxy info too.
    Closes: #277481, #284794
  * CD stuff works ok in noninteractive/preseeded modes. Closes: #282356
  * Adds deb-src lines for everything, including security updates.
    Closes: #269154.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Various small fixes.
  * Call the main package apt-setup-udeb to allow for apt-setup.deb in the
    future.
  * Add translation infrastructure.
  * Set epoch to supersede the base-config-based apt-setup-udeb in Ubuntu.
  * Don't bother looking for security updates for unstable.
  * Strip everything after the first dot from generator names when
    constructing progress template names, to allow writing variants of a
    generator with the same basic purpose as the original.
  * Initial untested mirror generator for Ubuntu. Not added to translation
    infrastructure yet, although the templates are there.
