>4.1. SELinux</A
></H2
><P
>Vodafone Mobile Connection Card Driver for Linux does a lot of things that SELinux doesn't like, as load libraries and run binaries installed in non-standard paths, load and unload kernel modules, use and lock devices... This installer includes some policies and labeling commands for telling SELinux what we are doing so it can trust in us. In this way, this application works on Fedora 7 and 8 with out of the box SELinux settings. It should also work on other distributions with SELinux, if not, please give us some feedback.</P

>Make sure you have the permissions needed to connect with a serial device. You can see in what groups you are with the command <B
CLASS="command"
>id</B
>. Check what group owns /dev/ttyUSB* (<B
CLASS="command"
>ls -l /dev/ttyUSB*</B
>) and see if your user belongs to it. You should be part of groups vmc, uucp, dialout and probably lock. From command-line you can add a user to those groups with the command <B
CLASS="command"
>/usr/sbin/usermod -a -G vmc, uucp, dialout, lock &#60;user&#62;</B

>If you have selected a user as allowed to run the application during installation, or you have added him or her to the required groups and you follow experiencing permission issues, make sure the session permissions have been updated (watch <B
CLASS="command"
>id &#60;user&#62;</B
>) and restart all sessions of this user. If you want to be sure that all sessions are restarted reboot your computer.</P

></H2
><P
>Specially if you are using Novatel Ovation MC950D you can experience problems with the detection of your card when using other serial devices. It's because we reload usbserial module while configuring the device. You can unplug all your usb serial devices (including your GPRS/3G card), remove the modules that are using usbserial (last column in <B
CLASS="command"
>lsmod | grep usbserial</B
>) and plug again your GPRS/3G card.</P
