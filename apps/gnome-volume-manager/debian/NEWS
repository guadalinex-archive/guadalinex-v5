gnome-volume-manager (1.1.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  As of this version gnome-volume-manager uses pmount for mounting and
  unmounting devices. To be able to use pmount, the user must be a 
  member of the plugdev group. If a user isn't part of this group,
  gnome-volume-manager will be unable to mount devices!

  For more information about pmount and its policy see the pmount manpage.
