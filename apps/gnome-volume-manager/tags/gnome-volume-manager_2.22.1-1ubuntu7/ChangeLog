	setting, as it really doesn't make sense to have it
	Change the percent_threshold default to 0.05
	Change the percent_used default to 0.01

	really make sense to have it here

	callback function so we can listen for the "Disconnected"
	signal. We no longer intergrate with the g_main loop.

	the same, only we now call gvm_dbus_init() rather than the old
	hal_mainloop_integration function that was replaced by
	gvm_dbus_init(). We now also have to set the dbus_connection on
	the hal context ourselves.
	(gvm_dbus_filter_function): Catch the disconnected signal and
	setup a timeout to reconnect to DBus.
	(reinit_dbus): Re-init DBus and then HAL.

	notifications are not enabled
	(main): If notifications are enabled, then intialize the notification
	daemon, and hash table for storing information about the volumes

	* src/manager.c (main): If GOption is available, use that instead
	of popt to work around bug #327587 (afaik, it's a bug in popt or
	libgnome-2.13 and not g-v-m, but easy to work around and GOption
	is kinda nice).

	gnome-mount - like the uid= option.

2006-01-19  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c: Added autokeyboard*, automouse*, and autotablet*
	settings to the gconf settings table as they were not already
	there somehow... (oops).

2006-01-06  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c (mount_all): If the drive isn't removable and/or
	is not hot-pluggable, check the automount enabled hint to decide
	if the volume should be mounted. This should prevent mounting of
	volumes that we shouldn't be mounting.
	(gvm_running_on_console): Removed.
	(main): Revamped rml's --no-daemon patch to use popt and added
	more fun and exciting argument flags.
	(gvm_user_at_console): New function to check that the user is
	logged-in at the console using a similar check to dbus.
	(gvm_user_active_at_console): Placeholder function to decide if
	the user's session is the active session at the console. Currently
	always returns TRUE.
	(hal_device_condition): Check that the user is the active console
	user.
	(hal_property_modified): If a volume is mounted and it's not in
	our mount queue and the user isn't active at the console, do
	nothing.
	(hal_device_added): Check that the user is the active user.

2006-01-05  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Bumped version to 1.5.8

	* src/manager.c (gvm_device_mount): Applied a patch from J5 to fix
	bug #324618.

2006-01-04  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Patch by Matthias Clasen to add
	--enable/disable-debug to fix bug #320997.

	* src/gvm-dev-tablet.png: Added to fix bug #318637.

	* src/properties.c: Changed tablet icon to be a file path.
	(set_icon): If the icon name is a full path, load the image from a
	file instead of from a theme.

	* src/manager.c (mount_all): Set mount = FALSE each pass thru the
	loop before doing the logic to decide if we should mount.

2005-12-19  Robert Love  <rml@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Bump version to 1.5.7

2005-12-19  Robert Love  <rml@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c: By default, daemonize via daemon().  Add "--no-daemon"
	  option to disable this.

2005-12-19  Robert Love  <rml@novell.com>

	* configure.in: remove "-Wcast-qual" as it generates a bit of noise.

2005-12-12  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Bumped version to 1.5.6

2005-12-09  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c (gvm_device_mount): Updated to the changes in the
	method signature (which has changed to
	string,string,array:string). Also pass the sync mount option if
	the device is smaller than 256M.
	(gvm_device_unmount): Method name changed to Unmount rather than
	UnMount.

2005-12-07  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Bumped version to 1.5.5

	* src/gvm.h: Removed [un]mount_command and eject_command strings.

	* gnome-volume-manager.schemas.in: Removed the mount_command,
	unmount_command and eject_command keys, these are no longer used.

	* src/manager.c (gvm_device_mount): Rewrote to use the new HAL
	Mount dbus method.
	(gvm_device_unmount): Rewrote to use the new HAL UnMount method.
	(unmount_all): Simplified since we no longer need the block.device
	(gvm_load_config): Removed special-case [un]mount
	command gconf setting handling code.
	(gvm_config_changed): Same.
	(hal_device_condition): Handle the eject event by
	invoking the Eject() method on HAL via dbus.

2005-10-27  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Bumped version to 1.5.4

2005-10-26  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* gnome-volume-manager.schemas.in: Added mount_command and
	unmount_command keys.

	* configure.in: Instead of allowing compile-time command-lines be
	specified for mounting/unmounting, instead allow specification of
	only the command-line options for mount and pmount. G-V-M will now
	do run-time analysis of which program to use, overrideable by the
	user via gconf keys.

	* src/manager.c (gvm_device_mount): Modified to user a
	user-defined mount command or, failing that, falls back to
	pmount-hal and then back to mount. No longer depends on a mount
	command being specified at configure-time.
	(gvm_device_unmount): Same but for unmount commands.

2005-10-19  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c (gvm_autorun): Fixed a type-o, autobrowse should
	default to TRUE not FALSE.

2005-10-18  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c (gvm_check_vcd): Fixed a type-o.

2005-10-17  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c (gvm_cdrom_policy): Determine if the cdrom media
	is writable in a different way to solve bug #128081.
	(input_device_added): Only set handled to TRUE if the command was
	configured to run.

2005-10-14  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/properties.c (show_props): Updated to use GtkIconTheme and
	listen to theme changes. Fixes bug #318683.

	* src/manager.c (prompt_response_cb): Remove ourselves from the
	dialog hash.
	(gvm_prompt): Add ourselves to the dialog hash.
	(hal_device_removed): If there's a dialog prompting the suer what
	to do with the device that was just removed, cancel the dialog
	prompt.
	(gvm_prompt): Changed to use GtkIconTheme instead of GnomeIconTheme.

2005-10-04  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Bump version to 1.5.3

	* src/manager.c: What used to be referred to as PTP cameras are
	now just "cameras" and what sued to be "camera" is now "storage
	camera" and so some renaming of enums and function names has been
	done.
	(gvm_udi_is_camera): Instead of checking that the access_method is
	"ptp", check that the access_method is simply not "storage". Also
	added smarts for compatability with the current broken libgphoto2
	fdi files... hopefully someday they'll get fixed to either comply
	with HAL's camera.* attribute specs or the ones I proposed to the
	list.

2005-10-04  Robert Love  <rml@novell.com>

	* configure.in: bump version tp 1.5.2
	* src/manager.c: Discs are "blank" not "empty"; fix 'uninitialized var'
	  warning in hal_device_added().

2005-09-29  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/properties.c: Added support for new PocketPC settings.

	* src/manager.c: Added support for new PocketPC settings.
	(pda_device_added): Handle pocketpc devices.

2005-09-27  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c (gvm_running_on_console): New function to decide
	if g-v-m is on the system console.
	(main): If not on the system console, exit (no sense running).

2005-09-16  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	Fix for bug #316486

	* src/manager.c (gvm_device_mount): Now takes an argument as to
	whether policy should be applied once mounted.
	(cda_extra_cb): Updated.
	(gvm_ask_mixed): Updated.
	(gvm_cdrom_policy): Updated.
	(block_device_added): Updated.
	(hal_property_modified): Only apply policy if specified to do so.
	(mount_all): Updated.

2005-08-30  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Bumped version to 1.5.1

2005-08-25  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* gnome-volume-properties.glade: Made all items use
	GtkFileChoosers instead of GtkFileSelectionDialogs.

	* src/manager.c (gvm_udi_is_ptp_camera): Disabled the camera
	capability query since this function is only ever called when the
	camera capaqbility has already been found on the device.

2005-08-24  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c (hal_device_added): Modified so that device
	handlers take a capability argument as well as returning
	TRUE/FALSE for whether or not they've handled the device.
	(input_device_added): Optimised to use the matched capability from
	hal_device_added() to decide what to do rather than doing our own
	query for the same info.
	(to_be_or_not_to_be): Iterate over all settings with a nice loop
	to decide if we need to live or die.

2005-08-24  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c (hal_device_added): Optimised by calling
	libhal_device_get_property_strlist() with the key
	info.capabilities to avoid all the extra overhead of calling
	libhal_device_query_capability() for each of the capabilities that
	we can handle.

2005-08-24  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Updated to require hal >= 0.5.4 (we need the pda
	fixes included with this release)

	* src/manager.c (hal_device_added): Rewrote to be table-driven.

2005-08-23  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c (gvm_run_palmsync): New function to exec the palm
	sync program.
	(hal_device_added): Detect palm devices being connected. Also
	removed the redundant 'char *device' variable.

	* src/properties.c: Added Palm-Pilot UI stuff.

2005-08-22  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c (gvm_check_dir): Need to NULL terminate
	g_build_filename varargs, duh.

2005-08-19  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Bumped version to 1.5.0

2005-08-16  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* gnome-volume-manager.schemas.in: Removed the
	autoburn_photo_cd_command item. Added burn_cd/burn_dvd prompt
	items. Also changed the eject command to "/bin/eject %d" so that
	it actually works (eject without an arg tries to eject /dev/cdrom
	which may or may not be what we want to eject).

	* src/properties.c: Removed the autoburn_photo_cd_command stuff.

	* src/manager.c: Many wording changes to the user prompts. Removed
	autoburn_photo_cd stuff.
	(gvm_prompt): Fixed various padding/spacing issues to make all
	dialogs comply with the HIG. Also make sure to not save the user
	response if they cancel the dialog. Other changes include taking
	argc/argv instead of varargs and allowing secondary text to
	contain mockup.
	(gvm_run_cdburner): Remove the BURN_PHOTO_CD case.
	(hal_device_added): For the PTP Camera case, use its own camera
	prompt (which does not have the "Open Folder" choice).
	(gvm_device_mounted): In the USB Mass-Storage camera case, handle
	the case where the user selects "Open Folder".

	* src/gvm.h: Removed the burn_photo_command member.

2005-08-19  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c (gvm_check_dir): New function to check for the
	existance of a directory in a case-insensitive manner.
	(gvm_check_dvd): Use gvm_check_dir()
	(gvm_check_vcd): New function to detect a VCD
	(gvm_autorun): Check for VCDs here too.
	(gvm_check_photos): Use gvm_check_dir()

2005-08-18  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c (gvm_autorun): Free the path on access failure.

2005-08-18  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Bumped version to 1.3.5

2005-08-15  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* gnome-volume-manager.schemas.in: Changed the default CD player
	to `totem %d` rather than gnome-cd since apparently gnome-cd is a
	dead project. Also disabled cd burning and defaulted all the
	command-lines to use nautilus' cd burning command-line. Also
	disabled autoipod and autophoto since Mono apps aren't included in
	gnome-core. Also disabled autokeyboard and automouse seeing as how
	yast2 is very distro-specific. Also disabled autovideocam seeing
	as how Kino also isn't a gnome-core app.

2005-08-12  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c (hal_property_modified): Call gvm_device_mounted()
	even if the udi wasn't in our mount queue.
	(gvm_prompt): Fix expand/fill arguments for box_pack_start for all
	widgets so things look nicer. Also disable label selection (these
	aren't error dialogs).

2005-08-10  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c (hal_device_added): Don't call
	gvm_device_mounted() in the subfs case, we'll get a "mounted"
	event when subfs mounts it.
	(gvm_ask_mixed): Same.
	(gvm_cdrom_policy): Same.

2005-08-10  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c (gvm_device_is_writer): Return the type of burner
	the device is (cd vs dvd) if it is a burner.
	(gvm_run_cdburner): Change our prompt depending on what type of
	burner device it is.
	(gvm_cdrom_policy): Pass the returned type from is_writer() to
	run_cdburner()

	* gnome-volume-properties.glade: Added TM to iPod label.

2005-08-09  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* gnome-volume-manager.schemas.in: Change the autoplay_dvd default
	to true - it makes sense to default the same as autoplay_cda and
	it's likely to be expected by users. Also changed autobrowse to
	true and autorun to false.

2005-08-08  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c (mount_all): Fixed some if-logic.

2005-08-03  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c: Reword the CD-Extra prompt to be less
	confusing. Fixes bug #308856.

2005-08-03  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c: Capitalise CD in the user prompt dialog
	strings. Fixes bug #311622.

	* gnome-volume-manager.schemas.in: Fixed the iPod long
	description.

	* src/properties.c (main): s/applet/application/ - fixes bug
	#168515.

2005-07-29  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Removed the --enable-submount option.
	Bumped version to 1.3.4

	* src/manager.c (hal_device_added): Check info.callouts.ad for
	hald-block-subfs to see if submount will handle mounting this
	volume.
	(hal_property_modified): Only record mounted volumes that were in
	our mount queue (e.g. don't record them if submount mounted them
	or they were mounted manually by the user) - allows us to get rid
	of the nasty #ifdef's.
	(unmount_all): Remove #ifdef's, no longer needed.
	(mount_all): Check for subfs flags so that we don't mount anything
	that subfs plans on handling.
	(sigterm_iochn_data): Always call unmount_all()
	(gvm_die): Same.
	(main): Always call mount_all().
	(gvm_device_mount): Take care of adding the udi to the mount table
	here to remove the need to do it manually every place we are
	called.
	(gvm_cdrom_policy): Remove #ifdefs for subfs, use our hal flag
	check instead.
	(gvm_run_command): Fixed - we can't get the exit status of the run
	program, we were getting the pid and using that as the exit status
	- oops. Instead, return TRUE or FALSE based on whether or not
	g_spawn_async() worked.
	(gvm_device_mount): Fixed to handle run_command's new return
	values.
	(gvm_device_unmount): Same.

2005-07-29  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c (gvm_udi_is_camera): We can't check the volume udi
	for the camera property, we have to check the physical device udi.
	(gvm_udi_is_ptp_camera): Check that the string property,
	camera.access_method, is "ptp" instead of checking the bool
	property, camera.libgphoto2_support which doesn't exist.

2005-07-29  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c (gvm_udi_is_camera): No longer takes a
	check_gphoto2 arg - now just a basic camera check.
	(gvm_udi_is_ptp_camera): Checks to see if the camera is a PTP
	camera (checks that the camera.libgphoto2_support property exists
	and is set to TRUE - if unset, return whether or not the device is
	a camera).
	(hal_device_added): Use gvm_udi_is_ptp_camera() instead.

2005-07-22  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/gvm.h: Added more variables.

	* src/manager.c (gvm_udi_is_printer): Removed.
	(hal_device_added): Do the printer capability query here instead,
	since it's so simple to do. Also query for input devices and run
	commands if appropriate.

	* src/properties.c: Added scanners, mice, keyboards, tablets, and
	video-cams to the table.

2005-07-11  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Bumped version to 1.3.3

2005-07-08  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c (gvm_device_mounted): Need to pass
	mount_point/iPod_Control to the check_photos() routine or it won't
	find a DCIM directory.

2005-07-05  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c: Changed mounted_volumes_policy_queue linked list
	into a hash table instead (why was this ever a linked list? it
	just served as a lookup table).

2005-07-05  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	Based on a patch from Ubuntu developers.

	* src/manager.c (gvm_automount_enabled): New function to check
	HAL's automount_enabled_hint property on devices.
	(hal_device_added): Only mount the device if automount is enabled.

2005-07-05  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c (mount_all): Check whether we should mount the
	drive based on the user's auto-mount settings. Based on a patch by
	Ubuntu developers.

2005-07-05  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c: Use strcmp instead of g_ascii_strcasecmp() where
	appropriate (comparing hal keys and udi's).

	* src/properties.c (main): Make a note that the user needs kernel
	2.6 for it to work.

2005-07-05  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c (gvm_media_changed): Return TRUE if we handled the
	device or FALSE otherwise. Remove the mounting code.
	(hal_device_added): Don't check if the device is mountable before
	calling gvm_media_changed, that's kinda the point. If
	gvm_media_changed doesn't handle the device, THEN we can mount it
	if it is mountable.

2005-06-30  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Bumped version to 1.3.2

	* src/manager.c: #include dbus-glib-lowlevel.h to rid ourselves of
	that annoying warning about dbus_connection_setup_with_g_main()
	being undeclared.
	(gvm_device_is_writer): Rewrote as a loop to make this code more
	readable and more easily extended later - just ad an item to the
	list to check!

2005-06-29  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c (gvm_run_cdplayer): Don't check autoplay_cda here,
	simply run the command if one is set.
	(gvm_cdrom_policy): Check autoplay_cda before calling
	gvm_run_cdplayer()
	(gvm_run_command): We can't get the device if it wasn't passed to
	us (not all are block devices).

	* src/properties.c (show_props): Set the icon for the printer.

2005-06-28  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c (gvm_check_photos): Rewritten to check all
	case-variants of the dcim directory by scanning the mount point.

	Fixes to make it so that pluging in an iPod-Photo won't first
	prompt sync-music vs import-photos and then ask the user again if
	she'd like to import photos. Should also fix bug #155638.

	* src/manager.c (gvm_run_camera): Simplify. Don't prompt here,
	just run the command. Make our callers do the prompting.
	(gvm_autorun): Pass arguments in the proper order to
	gvm_check_dvd().
	(gvm_autorun): Do the photo-import prompting here.
	(gvm_run_ipod): Don't check autoipod here, leave that to our
	caller(s).
	(gvm_device_mounted): Check autophoto and autoipod here. Also, in
	the case of cameras, prompt for photo-import.

2005-06-27  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	Make sure that notification of changed-but-unwatched gconf keys
	don't confuse us into changing the state of the first watched
	gconf value.

	* src/properties.c (show_props): Make sure that no item in the
	hash table has a value of 0.
	(gconf_changed_cb): Updated for change.

	* src/manager.c (gvm_load_config): Make sure that no item in the
	hash table has a value of 0.
	(gvm_config_changed): Updated for change.

2005-06-27  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c (gvm_run_cdplayer): Fixed the order of arguemnts
	to be the same as everything else (oops, missed this one before).
	(hal_device_added): Don't abort simply because a volume isn't
	mountable or the fsusage isn't "filesystem". We need to work for
	audio cds too. Fix this by keeping track of the media's
	mountability.
	(gvm_prompt): Can't call g_error_free() on NULL. Also make sure to
	keep the reference to the image widget, duh.
	(gvm_prompt): Move the label creation to *after* we add the
	secondary text, doh!

2005-06-27  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c (hal_device_added): Check the fsusage, don't mount
	if it's not "filesystem". Avoids mounting the non-mountable volume
	on iPods.
	(gvm_udi_is_ipod): Check the storage_device for iPod info, not the
	mountable volume udi we are given.

2005-06-23  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c (gvm_run_cdburner): Fixed order of arguments.

2005-06-22  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Allow mount and unmount commands to be specified.

	* src/manager.c (gvm_run_command): Return the exit status of the
	command invoked.
	(gvm_device_mount): Now takes udi and mount_point arguments and
	calls gvm_run_command() to invoke the mount command.
	(gvm_device_unmount): Now takes udi and mount_point arguments and
	calls gvm_run_command() to invoke the unmount command.
	(gvm_ask_mixed): Fixed for gvm_device_mount() changes.
	(gvm_cdrom_policy): Same.
	(gvm_media_changed): Same.
	(hal_device_added): Same.
	(mount_all): Same.
	(unmount_all): Updated for changes to gvm_device_unmount().

2005-06-22  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c: Make all functions that take a udi, device, and
	mount_point argument use a consistant order: udi, device,
	mount_point.
	(main): Use g_signal_connect() rather than gtk_signal_connect()
	since the latetr is deprecated since gtk2.
	(gvm_run_command): Free the GError on error.
	(gvm_run_command): Changed the order of the arguments to be a
	little more logical (well, at least to me).
	(gvm_run_command): Rewrote the loop to not require a strdup of the
	command string and also fixed it such that the mount_point string
	gets properly shell quoted so that mount points with spaces will
	work as well as fixed to handle %% and properly handle other
	unknown %-cases to avoid getting into an infinite loop.
	(mount_all): Don't leak the fsusage property string.

2005-06-21  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* gnome-volume-manager.schemas.in: Make Sonance the default app
	for ipods.

	* src/manager.c: Add gconf keys for "don't ask me again"
	checkboxes in the table of prompts.

2005-06-17  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c (gvm_prompt): New function to prompt users (with
	the ability to save responses to prevent further pestering of the
	user if they choose "do not ask again").

2005-06-16  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c (gvm_check_photos): Don't launch the camera app
	here, let our caller do that.
	(gvm_autorun): if gvm_check_photos() returns TRUE, launch the
	camera app.

2005-06-14  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Instead of defaulting the mount/umount/nautilus
	paths to "no", default them to the command name (maybe it'll even
	work, whereas otherwise we run the command "no" which might never
	stop executing (think: `yes n`)). Also added a new configure
	option for ASSUME_SUBMOUNT.

	* gnome-volume-properties.glade: Added ipod settings.

	* gnome-volume-manager.schemas.in: Added ipod settings.

	* src/properties.c: Added the iPod config options to the table.
	(show_props): Load gnome-icon-ipod for the ipod icon.

	* src/manager.c: Conditionally disable the code that
	mounts/unmounts devices if ASSUME_SUBMOUNT is defined.
	(gvm_run_command): Instead of erroring when a parameter is
	unavailable, just replace it with an empty string so that at least
	it's possible that the program runs.
	(gvm_ask_autorun): Pass the path argument to the dialog string.
	(gvm_udi_is_camera): Function to detect cameras given a UDI
	(gvm_udi_is_ipod): Same but for iPods
	(gvm_run_camera): Handle prompting the user for both actual
	cameras and storage devices containing a dcim directory (no need
	to duplicate the code).
	(gvm_check_photos): Modified to call gvm_run_camera()
	(gvm_device_mounted): New function that does magic on mounted
	devices to see what they are and act accordingly. Split out from
	hal_property_modified().
	(hal_device_added): In the case that the device is not a
	mass-storage device, check if it is a camera (to support PTP
	cameras).
	(hal_property_modified): Call gvm_device_mounted().

2005-06-07  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c (hal_property_modified): Use g_ascii_strcasecmp
	instead of g_strcasecmp as the latter is deprecated.

	* configure.in: Added "he" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2005-06-01  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* gnome-volume-properties.glade: Renamed various widgets to match
	their gconf key names to make it easier to make the code
	table-driven on gconf keys.

	* src/properties.c: Changed to be table-driven like manager.c
	which more easily allows us to save single setting chanegs rather
	than re-saving all settings whenever any setting changes.

2005-05-26  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* src/manager.c (gvm_config_changed): Instead of free()ing all the
	settings and then reloading everything from scratch, just update
	the changed setting.
	(gvm_load_config): Changed to allow more easier setting updates
	(everything is now table-driven)
	(to_be_or_not_to_be): Split out from gvm_load_config()
