TODO for gnome-volume-manager itself:

- the specfile does not start the daemon, and it does not register itself with
  the session manager until it runs, so it or the capplet need to be run once
  before it is run automatically.
  
- the specfile does not ensure that hald (and thus dbus-daemon-1) are running

- get rid of the capplet entirely and integrate the choices in with Preferred
  Applications, et cetera

- see bugzilla.gnome.org for bugs
