gnome-volume-manager (2.22.1-1ubuntu7) hardy; urgency=low

  * Add integration patch with mount-systray

gnome-volume-manager (2.22.1-1ubuntu6) hardy; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/01_set_defaults.patch: Enable autophoto command for
    f-spot-import again, since currently we cannot use the nautilus support
    for photo cameras. This finally fixes automatic photo import again for
    Hardy. (LP: #208467)

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 15 Apr 2008 09:58:25 +0200

gnome-volume-manager (2.22.1-1ubuntu5) hardy; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/01_set_defaults.patch: Disable autoscanner command by
    default, it is too intrusive and has never worked until recently anyway
    (due to a bug). Leave autoscanner_command in place, so that users which
    want it can enable xsane auto-popup with an easy click. (LP: #211358)

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Sun, 06 Apr 2008 10:12:16 -0600

gnome-volume-manager (2.22.1-1ubuntu4) hardy; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/01_set_defaults.patch: Disable autophoto commands, it's
    handled by nautilus now.

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 31 Mar 2008 17:37:50 +0200

gnome-volume-manager (2.22.1-1ubuntu3) hardy; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/00_disable_media_handling.patch: Disable handling of CD
    eject, nautilus does that now. (LP: #202931)
  * Add debian/patches/02_fix_autokeyboard_gconf.patch: Fix gconf option
    indexes, so that automount_media actually moves to the correct index and
    is properly ignored by debian/patches/00_disable_media_handling.patch.
    This should also fix a couple of other "configuration is ignored" bugs.
    (LP: #209586)
  * Add debian/patches/08_fix_scanner_support.patch: Fix getting device node
    from scanners, so that the autoscanner command works again. (LP: #36137)
  * Disable 95_ubuntu_auto_unmount_notifications.patch: It has never really
    worked reliably, it stopped working since automounting moved to nautilus
    and gvfs, and upstream won't accept it. As a side effect, this obsoletes
    the "incorrect string" bug. (LP: #160782)

gnome-volume-manager (2.22.1-1ubuntu2) hardy; urgency=low

  * Add debian/patches/00_disable_media_handling.patch:
    - Disable media handling code and preferences UI, since nautilus does that
      now.
    - Patches taken from upstream bugzilla (see patch header), fixed the
      second patch and sent it back to upstream.
  * debian/patches/01_set_defaults.patch: Adapt to patch above.

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 29 Feb 2008 15:54:46 +0100

gnome-volume-manager (2.22.1-1ubuntu1) hardy; urgency=low

  * Merge with Debian unstable. Remaining Ubuntu changes:
    - debian/patches/01_set_defaults.patch: Ubuntu preferences for programs:
      + Audio CD burning: brasero -a
      + Photo import: f-spot-import
    - debian/patches/07_low_disk_space_no_media.patch: Do not issue 'low disk
      space' notifications for volumes mounted to /media/.
    - debian/patches/95_ubuntu_auto_unmount_notifications.patch: Display
      'unsafe device removal' notification if a device is removed without
      being unmounted. (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutoUnmountNotifications)
    - debian/gnome-volume-manager.links: Add gnome-volume-manager-gthumb.sh
      symlink to /usr/share/gnome-volume-manager/, where it had been shipped
      in old Ubuntu releases. Since this cannot be changed on system upgrades,
      this needs to be kept indefinitely.
  * debian/patches/01_set_defaults.patch: Disable automounting and
    autobrowsing of drives and media, since this functionality gets gradually
    absorbed into nautilus. This breaks automounting of encrypted devices for
    the time being, though (this needs to be fixed in nautilus). (LP: #188004)
  * Drop Recommends/Suggests of gthumb and serpentine, we don't install/use them
    by default any more. (LP: #183278)

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 07 Feb 2008 11:17:01 +0100

gnome-volume-manager (2.22.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    + debian/rules:
      - Remove moving of the autostart file as the location is fixed
        upstream now.
  * debian/control:
    + Move serpentine and rhythmbox to suggests. People who want the
      corresponding features should install them (Closes: #455467).
  * debian/patches/01_set_defaults.patch,
    debian/control:
    + Set autoprinter command to nothing as gnome-cups-add doesn't understand
      hal:// URIs. Thanks to Martin Pitt for noticing.
      Also don't suggest gnome-cups-manager for this reason anymore.

gnome-volume-manager (2.22.0-1ubuntu1) hardy; urgency=low

  * Merge with Debian unstable. Remaining Ubuntu changes:
    - debian/patches/01_set_defaults.patch: Disable autprinter command.
      gnome-cups-manager does not get along with hal:// URLs anyway, and we do
      not even install it by default any more. We use system-config-printer
      and hal-cups-utils, which do the right thing.
    - debian/patches/07_low_disk_space_no_media.patch: Do not issue 'low disk
      space' notifications for volumes mounted to /media/.
    - debian/patches/95_ubuntu_auto_unmount_notifications.patch: Display
      'unsafe device removal' notification if a device is removed without
      being unmounted. (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutoUnmountNotifications)
    - debian/gnome-volume-manager.links: Add gnome-volume-manager-gthumb.sh

gnome-volume-manager (2.22.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * debian/control
    - Add build dependency on autotools-dev for up-to-date config.{guess,sub}
      files.
    - The Vcs-* fields are now officially supported, so remove the XS- prefix.
  * debian/watch
    - Add a watch file to track upstream releases.

  [ Sebastian Dröge ]
  * New upstream release:
    + Supports parsing and running autorun.inf files on new volumes (disabled
      by default). (Closes: #407365).
    + Nautilus is not hardcoded anymore and can be changed to something
      else by setting GConf keys (Closes: #285314).
  * debian/gnome-volume-manager-gthumb:
    + Accept arbitrary capitalization of the 'dcim' folder of photo
      volumes (Closes: #452400).
      Taken from the Ubuntu package, change by Martin Pitt.
  * debian/rules:
    + Move g-v-m autostart file to the new location /etc/xdg/autostart.
      Also taken from the Ubuntu package (Closes: #452403).
  * debian/control:
    + Recommend sound-juicer for CDDA playback.
    + Recommend rhythmbox for media player plugging.
    + Suggest wine for the new autorun feature (disabled by default).
    + Suggest xsane for automatic scanner addition.
    + Suggest gnome-cups-manager for automatic printer addition.
    + Update Standards-Version to 3.7.3 (no additional changes needed).
  * debian/patches/01_set_defaults.patch,
    debian/control:
    + Updated for the new version and use/recommend serpentine as default
      audio burn application.

 -- Sebastian Dröge <slomo@debian.org>  Sun, 09 Dec 2007 14:25:31 +0100

gnome-volume-manager (2.22.0-0ubuntu1) hardy; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Lots of bug fixes.
    - Add support for scanner and webcam add/remove events.
    - Provide configuration option for specifying custom file managers.
    - Query ConsoleKit to check for active console.
  * Drop patches accepted upstream:
    - 02_honour_automount_enabled_hint.patch
    - 09_low_disk_space_always_show_mountpoint.patch
    - 94_ubuntu_xfce-autostart.patch
  * debian/patches/01_set_defaults.patch: Adapted to new upstream version.
  * Note: We do *not* enable ConsoleKit support. There's no need to do it in
    g-v-m, since hal will do the check anyway and fail the functions if the
    requesting g-v-m is not on an active console. No need to query twice.

gnome-volume-manager (2.17.0-2ubuntu3) hardy; urgency=low

  * Drop our Ubuntu specific changes for multiuser support, since PolicyKit
    does the right thing now:
    - Drop debian/patches/93_ubuntu_foreground_user.patch: No need to query
      libpam-foreground any more, our PK-enabled hal will now automatically
      reject mount attempts from inactive sessions.
    - debian/rules: Add back --disable-multiuser; it does not make a
      difference any more and just gets rid of a Delta to Debian.
    - Drop libpam-foreground dependency.
  * Add metadata tags to our patches and forward them upstream and to Debian.

gnome-volume-manager (2.17.0-2ubuntu2) gutsy; urgency=low

    suppress automounting if storage.automount_enabled_hint is False.
    (LP: #138537)

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 11 Sep 2007 12:22:24 +0200

gnome-volume-manager (2.17.0-2ubuntu1) gutsy; urgency=low

  * Merge with Debian unstable. Remaining Ubuntu changes:
    - Work correctly with multiple user sessions:
      + debian/rules: Remove --disable-multiuser configure option and install
        autostart .desktop file.
      + debian/control: Depend on libpam-foreground.
      + debian/patches/93_ubuntu_foreground_user.patch: libpam-foreground
        implementation of the gvm_active_user() stub.
    - debian/gnome-volume-manager-gthumb: Accept arbitrary capitalization of
      the 'dcim' folder of photo volumes. (LP #31190, Debian #452400)
    - debian/patches/01_set_defaults.patch: Use serpentine by default for
      audio CD burning.
    - debian/patches/07_low_disk_space_no_media.patch: Do not issue 'low disk
      space' notifications for volumes mounted to /media/.
    - debian/patches/09_low_disk_space_always_show_mountpoint.patch: Always
      display the mount point in the 'low disk space' notifications, otherwise
      they may get too confusing.
    - debian/patches/94_ubuntu_xfce-autostart.patch: Use autostart desktop
      file in XFCE, too.
    - debian/patches/95_ubuntu_auto_unmount_notifications.patch: Display
      'unsafe device removal' notification if a device is removed without
      being unmounted. (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutoUnmountNotifications)
    - debian/gnome-volume-manager.links: Add gnome-volume-manager-gthumb.sh

gnome-volume-manager (2.17.0-0ubuntu1) feisty; urgency=low

  * New upstream release with some minor bug fixes.
  * Remove obsolete patches:
    - 10_low_disk_space_gettext.patch: Adopted upstream.
    - 90_ubuntu-multiseat.patch: Not supported any more, never got feedback.
    - 91_ubuntu-remove_default_audio_dev.patch,
      92_ubuntu-new_audio_notification.patch: We don't mess with ALSA
      configuration any more; this is superseded by gstreamer's gconf keys and
      PulseAudio's default device selection.
  * Switch orig.tar.gz back to original upstream tarball and do not use
    tarball.mk any more (this follows Debian's change and is consistent with
    all other Gnome packages).

  * Remove debian/patches/02_pmount_crypt.patch,

    now.
  * debian/control: Drop pmount/eject dependencies, add gnome-mount

gnome-volume-manager (2.15.0-0ubuntu6) edgy; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/95_ubuntu_auto_unmount_notifications.patch:
    - Remove UDI of ripped out device from mounted_volumes, so that the next
      mount/unmount of it does not cause an unsafe removal warning (because
      there are two entries for it in mounted_volumes).
    - Closes: LP#60137
  * debian/patches/02_pmount_crypt.patch:
    - Call gtk_window_set_skip_taskbar_hint() to have the password input
      dialog appear in the task bar. Closes: LP#47060
    - Check for existing cryptsetup before creating the GksuuiDialog, so that
      we don't accumulate unused dialogs in memory if cryptsetup is not
      installed.
    - Use nonblocking open() with a timeout for opening the passphrase FIFO
      instead of using fopen(); the latter blocks eternally if pmount dies for
      some reason (e. g. the target device is not removable). Closes: LP#46529

gnome-volume-manager (2.15.0-0ubuntu4) edgy; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/95_ubuntu_auto_unmount_notifications.patch: Refactorize and

    work also with the recent change to using hal's storage backend.

gnome-volume-manager (2.15.0-0ubuntu3) edgy; urgency=low

  * Remove debian/patches/03_no_gnome_mount.patch: Our current hal now
    supports the Mount/Unmount/Eject interface in a safe fashion, so we can
    drop this intrusive patch to just use hal's backend. This also
    automatically makes gnome-mount work if it is installed.
  * debian/control: Bump hal dependency to >= 0.5.7.1-0ubuntu4 to ensure that
    we can use its Mount interface.

  * New upstream version:

    - Many bug fixes and patch adoptions.
    - New translations.
  * Drop debian/patches/04_at_console.patch: upstream now reads utmp to

    pam-console/pam-foreground for this any more.
  * Drop patches which were adopted upstream:

    This requires us to jump through some hoops, but much of the code could be
    stolen from eject. Closes: LP#40449
  * debian/control: Add 'eject' dependency. We need the
    /usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device helper for above patch, and eject itself
    is also needed for handling the hardware eject buttons of CD-ROM drives.

  * Add replacement debian/patches/93_ubuntu_foreground_user.patch: Use
    libpam-foreground's new check-foreground-console to provide an
    implementation for gvm_user_active_at_console(). This is ugly, but will
    have to do until dbus is fixed.
  * debian/control: Bump libpam-foreground dependency to >= 0.3 to ensure that

gnome-volume-manager (1.5.15-0ubuntu2) dapper; urgency=low

  * Add debian/patches/93_ubuntu_foreground_user.patch:
    - gvm_user_active_at_console(): Provide a real implementation instead of
      the 'return TRUE' dummy. Try to call the dbus function
      org.freedesktop.Hal.Device.Volume.Unmount with bogus arguments (whose
      D-BUS policy is at_console) and return FALSE if the dbus call is
      rejected with an AccessDenied error.
    - This finally solves the race condition of multiple g-v-m daemons if more
      than one user is logged in.
    - Closes: LP#10581
  * debian/patches/01_set_defaults.patch:
    - autoplay_{vcd,dvd}_command: Call totem with the mount point (%m) instead
      of the device name (%d) since that's what totem expects nowadays.
    - Fixes autoplay of DVDs and Video CDs.
    - Closes: LP#36301
  * debian/patches/02_pmount_crypt.patch: If an encrypted volume is detected
    without cryptsetup being installed, tell the user about that instead of
    failing silently.

gnome-volume-manager (1.5.15-0ubuntu1) dapper; urgency=low

  * New upstream version:
    - Install autostart .desktop file into /usr/share/gnome/autostart instead
      of /usr/share/autostart.
    - Reduce 'low disk space' warning to threshold to 5%. (Malone #33770)
    - Remove percent_freed gconf value and usage, so that low disk space
      notifications do not stop at 97.5%. (Malone #33058)
    - Small bug fixes.
  * debian/rules: Adapt moving of the autostart file to /etc/xdg/autostart.
  * Adapted patches to new upstream version:
    - 02_pmount_crypt.patch
  * Add debian/patches/07_low_disk_space_no_media.patch:
    - Do not notify about low disk space on mounts below /media (usually
      removable drives) since they are just annoying and not critical for
      system stability. (Malone #32370)
  * Add debian/patches/08_low_disk_space_no_readonly.patch:
    - Use statvfs() instead of statfs() since the latter is deprecated and
      statvfs() additionally tells us mount flags.
    - Do not notify about low disk space for read-only mounts. (Malone #34618)
  * Add debian/patches/09_low_disk_space_always_show_mountpoint.patch:
    - Always show the mount point in low disk space notifications to avoid
      confusion with ambiguous labels (but only if the label is different from
      the mount point). (Malone #31441)

    - 03_no_gnome_mount.patch
    - 99_autotools.patch
  * debian/patches/04_no_at_console.patch:

    - Add dependency to libpam-foreground.
    - Renamed to 04_at_console.patch.

      does not check the exit code. Use g_spawn_sync() instead and do not
      execute policy if mounting fails.

  * debian/patches/12_no_autorun.patch:
    - Dropped, we do want autorun in Ubuntu. This accidentially slid in on the
      previous merge.
  * debian/patches/10_improve_mounting.patch:
    - Dropped: Configurable suppressing of auto mount is now in
      07_automount_enabled_hint.patch, the "do not attempt to mount already
      mounted volumes" part is upstream, rest of the patch was undocumented.
  * debian/patches/11_track_cdrom_changes.patch:
    - Dropped, does not seem to be necessary any more with this version.
  * debian/rules:
    - Configure to use pmount-hal/pumount as mount/umount programs.

    + debian/patches/03_browse_fixup.patch (renamed to 01_browse_fixup.patch)
    + debian/patches/30_26_kernel_hint.patch (renamed to 03_kernel_hint.patch)
    + debian/patches/06_mount_at_start.patch

    + debian/patches/33_track_cdrom_changes.patch
      (renamed to 11_track_cdrom_changes.patch)
    + debian/patches/40_no_autorun.patch
      (renamed to 12_no_autorun.patch)
  * debian/paches/20_specify_programs.patch replaced by
    debian/paches/02_pmount.patch and debian/paches/09_nautilus_path.patch. 
    Which is are simpler patches that just hardcodes pmount and the nautilus
    path. (Patches from Martin Pitt)
  * debian/patches/13_dont_set_capabilities.patch
    + Dropped. Only surpresses a debug message, not really needed.
  * debian/patches/34_compiler_warnings.patch
    + Dropped. Fixed upstream
  * debian/patches/06_mount_crypt.patch
    + When an encrypted volume is inserted ask for the password and mount it
      using pmount. (Needs cryptsetup with luks patches)
  * debian/patches/07_dialogs_info.patch
    + Added. Change the dialogs to be info instead of warning.

gnome-volume-manager (1.3.1-0ubuntu7) breezy; urgency=low

  * Added debian/patches/09_nautilus_path.patch: Explicitly specify path to
    nautilus since configure will not find nautilus on the buildds.
    (Ubuntu #11924)

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 22 Jun 2005 09:53:47 +0200

gnome-volume-manager (1.3.1-0ubuntu6) breezy; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/06_pmount_crypt.patch:
    - Do not use a modal passphrase dialog, but call it asynchronously and
      do the mounting in a callback. With a modal dialog, mounting several
      partitions at the same time caused a dbus deadlock sometimes.
    - Code cleanup.

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Thu,  2 Jun 2005 17:00:44 +0200

gnome-volume-manager (1.3.1-0ubuntu5) breezy; urgency=low

  * Added debian/patches/07_dialogs_info.patch:
    - Hotplug popups are now information dialogs, not warnings.
    - Ubuntu #10651
  * Added debian/patches/08_photographss_typo.patch:
    - Fix typo "photographss" in src/manager.c and all translations.
  * debian/patches/06_pmount_crypt.patch:
    - Use g_child_watch_add() with a callback instead of waitpid(), since the
      latter does not work properly with g_spawn_async(). This could fix
      Ubuntu #11207.
    - If calling pmount-hal fails, and we have an encrypted device, show an
      error message box. (Ubuntu #11208)

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Tue, 31 May 2005 15:33:23 +0200

gnome-volume-manager (1.3.1-0ubuntu4) breezy; urgency=low

  * Added debian/patches/06_pmount_crypt.patch:
    - src/manager.c: Check whether a volume is encrypted; if so, use
      gksu_ask_password() to query the passphrase.
    - Add encryption_secret parameter to gvm_device_mount(). If it is present,
      create a temporary FIFO for passing the secret to pmount (which passes
      it to cryptsetup).
    - configure.in: Check for and use libgksuui1.0.
  * Added debian/patches/99_autotools.patch:
    - Result of autoconf run to make configure.in changes effective.
  * debian/control: Added build dependency libgksuui1.0-dev.

gnome-volume-manager (1.3.1-0ubuntu3) breezy; urgency=low

  * Added debian/patches/04_reconnect_on_dbus_exit.patch:
    - Rewrote Hoary patch, which did not work with the new dbus and g-v-m.
    - New: now it even works (Gnome #170894) :-)
  * Added debian/patches/05_multiseat.patch:
    - Ported from Hoary version to new hal API.
    - hal 0.5 does not offer kernel_devname any more; completely reworked
      device matching, now based on sysfs paths.
  * debian/patches/02_pmount.patch: Undefine BIN_[U]MOUNT before redefining it
    to avoid compiler warning.
  * debian/rules: Remove obsolete configure options.
  * Disabled 04_luks.patch for now until it actually does something sensible.

gnome-volume-manager (1.3.1-0ubuntu1) breezy; urgency=low

  * New upstream version which works with new hal (0.5) and dbus (0.32) APIs.
  * Adopted patches to work with new upstream version:
    - 00_set_defaults.patch
    - 03_browse_fixup.patch (renamed to 01_browse_fixup.patch)
    - 30_26_kernel_hint.patch (renamed to 03_kernel_hint.patch)
  * Dropped patches:
    - 06_mount_at_start.patch (should not be necessary with pmount)
    - 11_dbus_reconnect_on_bus_exit.patch (has to be rewritten)
    - 13_dont_set_capabilities.patch (it's only cosmetical, avoids a debug
      warning)
    - 20_specify_programs.patch (this patch is nice, but huge, and upstream
      does not accept patches; replaced by 02_pmount.patch)
    - 32_cleanup_debugging.patch (not necessary any more with new hal)
  * Added debian/patches/02_pmount.patch:
    - Replaces old 20_specify_programs.patch with something simple, ugly, and
      hardcoded; override BIN_MOUNT and BIN_UMOUNT in gvm.h to use pmount-hal
      and pumount mount instead of [u]mount.
  * Added debian/patches/04_luks.patch:
    - Dummy support for encrypted removable devices following the LUKS
      standard. Just asks for secret, but does nothing for now (needs pmount
      and other backend support).

      - gvm_mount_device(): Add device to the mounted list even if mounting
        fails. With a data volume we don't need to try it again, and with a
        CD-ROM we want to avoid false "change" events on hald restarts.
    + Added debian/patches/34_compiler_warnings.patch:
      - Format string buffer overflow.
      - Include missing dbus/dbus-glib-lowlevel.h.
