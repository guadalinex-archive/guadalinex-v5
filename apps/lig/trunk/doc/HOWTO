How to use the Guadalinex Live Image Generator system

1 - Files:

There are three important files in this system:
 1.1 The configuration file: /etc/glig/conf
 1.2 The script itself: /usr/sbin/glig
 1.3 The log file: /var/log/glig-{date}.log


1.1 - The configuration file: /etc/glig/conf

The configuration file contains the default values for the vars the system 
is going to use. Such as:

mirror="file:///var/mirror/ubuntu/"
live_dir="/var/cdimage/live/edgy/ubuntu/current/"
sources="/tmp/sources/"
base="ubuntu-desktop,linux-image-generic"
live="casper,ubiquity-frontend-gtk,ubiquity-ubuntu-artwork,xfsprogs,jfsutils,ntfsprogs,discover1,xresprobe,laptop-detect"
# Parameters vars to default values
debootstrap="yes"
squashfs="yes"
keep_sources="no"
verbose="no"
quiet="no"


1.1.1 - The variables:

Now we are going to explain the most important variables that maybe you like
to change:

* General variables:
  - mirror: It's the URI of the repository from where the system gets the packages.
  	  It could be a local or remote one.
  - live_dir: This is the directory where GLIG is going to store the files
              generates. And the place where are supposed to be seeked from
  	    the cdimage system.
  - sources: This is the directory where GLIG will generate a temporary 
             debootstrap to work with.
  - base: Base is the list of packages or metapackages which will install the 
          whole distro.
  - live: The list of packages the live system needs to be Live or to be installed.

* Parameters by default (They are all boolean values. I mean "yes" or "no"):
  - deboostrap: Do you want to generate the debootstrap from the repository?
                By default the answer is "yes"
  - squashfs: Do you want to generate a compressed image of the debootstrap?
                By default the answer is "yes"
  - keep_sources: Do you want keep the temporary directory where the debootstrap
                  was generated?
                  By default the answer is "no"
  - verbose: Do you want a verbose output for debugging purposes? This active 
             the "set -x" bash ption for the script.
             By default the answer is "no"
  - quiet: Do you want every output from the program be redirected to the log file
  	   instead of the standard or error output?
           By default the answer is "no"
  


1.2 - The script itself: /usr/sbin/glig

This is just a bash script file but it is who run all the party. But the only 
user who can run this script is the root (or a sudoed user) because it needs
run debotstrap, mksquashfs and mkisofs, which some in this case need special
permissions for reading some file and directories.

The options are:

  Usage:
      glig [-h] [-d | --no-deboostrap] [-s | --no-squashfs] [-k | --keep-sources] [-q | --quiet] [-v | --verbose]
  
  Options:
      -h, --help             Show this help
      -d, --no-debootstrap   Not to build from the packages
      -s, --no-squashfs      Not to create the squashfs image
      -k, --keep-sources     Keep the sources directory after finish
      -q, --quiet            Don't show any messages
      -v, --verbose          Show more information about the execution


The normal way to use it is with no parameters. If the /etc/glig/conf is well 
defined, just running the command without parameters is enough.


1.3 - The log file: /var/log/glig-{date}.log

This is a log file which is generated on the fly by the "glig" program when
it is running by a root.

This file is going to be stored on /var/lib/ and the name will be:
/var/log/glig-{DATE}.log

Where {DATE} is the output of the command: date +%Y%m%d%H%M

Which means year + month + day + hour + minute
Example:
/var/log/glig-200611141038.log
